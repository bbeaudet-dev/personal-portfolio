A few moments in this show hit home for me, especially _Good For You_, but overall I wasn't overly impressed with this show.I expected to relate to the characters much more than I did, with me being more introverted, nerdy, and non-confrontational like the protagonist.

After seeing the trailer for the movie, I suspect that cinema might be a better medium for this story (I will add my thoughts here when I get around to watching it). I am of the belief that bringing a story to the Broadway stage, especially ones that already have movie or book adaptations, should bring something unique to the story and experience. For example, _Water For Elephants_ has stunning acrobatics and moving stage elements that are a spectacle to see in person, adding to the sense of wonder surrounding the circus as you're seeing the story unfold; _Wicked_ and _The Outsiders_ are good examples too. On the other hand, I didn't feel that _Dear Evan Hansen_ gained anything by being on the live stage - it doesn't make good use of the full size of the stage, and I felt that the screens everywhere were distracting and didn't really add to the story or the viewing experience.
