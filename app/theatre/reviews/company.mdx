I was honestly just confused the entire time. I know it’s a Sondheim classic and all, but it never clicked for me. And I have to say, I’m not a Patti LuPone fan — I did not understand any of the hype. 
This was one of the first shows I ever saw and might react to it better if I were to see it again.
