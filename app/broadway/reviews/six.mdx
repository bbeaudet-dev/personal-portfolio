This show just wasn’t for me. It felt more like a flashy concert than a piece of theatre — no plot, no emotional depth, and a kind of gaudy humor that I never really connect with. I don't really understand why it’s so popular, maybe I will see the Broadway version if I find cheap tickets. I left feeling bored and unmoved.
