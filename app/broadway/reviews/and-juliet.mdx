Unlike in Moulin Rouge, the pop songs in & Juliet did not seem to elevate the story or the music itself, instead feeling like "remixes for the sake of it". Cutting between the play itself and the crew putting on the play was entertaining, but I found the characters to often be shallow and over-dramatized, often feeling like a less-well-done _Some Like It Hot_.
& Juliet finds itself _right before_ the border of my "eh, I probably would've had more fun staying home" zone - just entertaining enough to still have been worth the trip to the theatre.
