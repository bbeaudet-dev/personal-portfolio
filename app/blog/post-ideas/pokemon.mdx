How is this different from tech-eval?



Some of my greatest "Aha!" moments in programming are connected, somehow or other, to Pokemon. I can study Full Stack Open all day and memorize syntax until my eyes bleed, but it's unfailingly when I connect a concept to its Pokemon equivalent that all the pieces finally snap into place and I'm suddenly full of ideas, confidence, and excitement.

Over the last month, I've been studying to pass Fractal's technical checkpoint - essentially building a backend Express server to handle CRUD operations and a frontend React app that renders database entries. The most common example is a simple notes app, but for extra practice, I decided to build a Pokedex instead. Just name, type, and id properties, but enough complexity to make it challenging: template strings to combine properties into "Pokedex entries," additional state variables, ordered lists, and trying to go from start to finish with minimal Googling.

I did it! Initially, I felt extremely proud and accomplished - but this feeling was soon hijacked by imposter syndrome, which told me my Pokedex was NOTHING compared to Bulbapedia and didn't provide value to anyone. I ignored that voice, at least for a bit.


### Dreams Without Labels

I'm pretty sure I know what I want to do. I had this moment in the car in Royal Oak, an intense feeling of "this is what I am called to do" - I can make games that transform people for the better, not for the worse.

But I'm also cognizant of what happens after making something concrete like this. The first time Parth and I went to dinner - which would catalyst him becoming a lifelong friend, roommate, groomsman, and companion in birding, transformative video games, and coding - we talked about what drove us, kept us up at night, how we want to change the world. We kept the conversation extremely abstract. Instead of "let's start a podcast," we discussed what about podcasts allows people to be transformed, why the release of ideas can be profound, what aspects of media truly provide value to humans.

At one point, I suggested something concrete - "I really want to start a YouTube channel" - and Parth immediately stopped me: "No no no, don't put a label on it yet, that will only limit us needlessly." I realized he was right. By putting such a concrete label on my dreams, I'd been holding myself back.

Ever since that dinner, I've been extremely cautious about assigning labels to dreams, ambitions, feelings. Also, Parth is cool.


### The Checkpoint

Staying up until 1am with Parth building a chatroom application. I'll be honest, I thought it was stupid when we started. I had 10 subtasks to showcase in 12 hours, and I figured our call would be a simple example to check boxes and ensure I was ready for evaluation.

We were not off to a good start. First, I thought his chatroom suggestion wasn't relevant to what I needed to build. Second, the first thing out of his mouth was "before we write any code, I like to write things out on paper first." Only after passing the evaluation with flying colors did I realize he was correct on both accounts.

Writing things out before building was extremely helpful - an important step to being a competent software engineer. However, I was impatient, so I decided to start building while we talked (sorry Parth). I had a "get it done" attitude and maybe even a subconscious desire for superiority ("I don't need silly exercises, I'll start the actual work while he dicks around with his notebook").

Karma would teach me a lesson. I had violated the software engineer's oath: build things one step at a time and verify your application works at each stage. Instead, I was starting every component I could think of, writing pieces that immediately came to mind ("need a useEffect here," "need an event handler," defining state variables, HTML skeleton, etc.).


### Memorization vs. Understanding

This gets at another idea I've been noodling on about competence. Back in grade school, I was a STEM kid through and through - advanced placement math, engineering courses - but always struggled with History, English, Theology. I distinctly remember feeling frustrated after bombing a 4th grade History exam: "I'll never be good at this stuff. I can memorize the material, but as soon as the teacher rewords the questions, I don't understand it anymore. It's like I can't access the information unless the question is in EXACTLY the same format."

This was my running theory for years - that my brain "only understands numbers and logic, not words or events I can't see." It wouldn't be superseded until 10+ years later when I thought: "Maybe it's NOT that my brain simply CAN'T demonstrate understanding - maybe I just didn't actually UNDERSTAND the material, but rather KNEW it from reading it a couple times. Therefore, my ability was limited to the single, exact context I learned it in. When presented with even a SLIGHTLY different context, my thought process broke down."

The same phenomenon reared its head during my initial technical checkpoint attempts. I had learned to create servers and React apps following tutorials, and mistook "having built this thing" for "actually understanding how this thing works and being able to build it, troubleshoot it, and explore alternatives." The same breakdown that occurred during my 4th grade history exam happened again over 10 years later.

But armed with my new theory of competence - and conviction that I AM good at coding - I understood that even if I conceptually grasped the material, I simply wasn't at the desired level of competence yet. I needed more practice.


### The Payoff

Those silly exercises Parth had me doing until 1am actually paid off. Or more succinctly: Parth was right, Ben was wrong.

I should've known better. It's fundamental to engineering to begin by laying out assumptions, problem definitions, and what you know, don't know, and need to know - all before working on solutions. This is what makes engineering difficult and separates good engineers from great ones. Good engineers know how to code and set up servers, but great engineers solve problems that haven't been solved before, create real solutions to real problems - without following tutorials.

As Einstein said: "If I had an hour to solve a problem, I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions."

I also gained a new insight: Parth is a better engineer than I give him credit for. He often defies my expectations, which can be confusing or frustrating, but more often reveals deep insights I didn't know I didn't know.
The API Revelation

After passing the technical, I wanted more practice before bootcamp starts. After briefly starting a task tracker, I decided to expand my Pokedex app. After adding PUT and DELETE routes, my brain was generating ideas faster than my fingers could code, so I created ideas.txt and began throwing every functionality I could think of onto the screen.

Adding base stats, abilities, held items, descriptions, sprites would be straightforward. But evolution and learnset made me stop. Should I create a nested 'evolution' object within 'pokemon'? Should evolveFromMethod and evolveToMethod both live there? How do I account for various evolution methods? With learnset, I started with [move, levelLearned] arrays, but quickly thought: I don't want to repeat move data every time a Pokemon can learn it, so how do I "call" move data when it appears in a learnset?

It wasn't until I'd mapped out this complex structure that I remembered something called "PokeAPI" in my bookmarks. One click and boom - all my questions were answered. Everything my brain had been furiously trying to process appeared on screen.

It was simultaneously validating, groundbreaking, and crushing. Validating because my "original idea" WAS valuable to people. Groundbreaking because my concept of possibility suddenly expanded. Crushing because seeing the paragon of your struggle-filled project makes all that effort feel...unnecessary.

But it's a good kind of crushing. Maybe feeling that your work was unnecessary is a necessary kind of crushing. Susan Sontag wrote that "depression is melancholy minus its charms." Feeling that your life and work is meaningless - that's depression, no charm to it. But discovering PokeAPI after unknowingly trying to reinvent it - that's melancholy. It inspires deeper understanding of oneself and the world, can be a source of inner strength.

After reflecting on where I'm at post-PokeAPI-discovery-and-giving-up-on-everything-I-was-working-on: Coding is still cool, I still want to become a really good engineer, and life can still be meaningful even when you're being crushed.

Until next time,

Ben B.
