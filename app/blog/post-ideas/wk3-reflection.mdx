Opposite actions
When I'm really craving sugar, what I need is water
When I really want to play video games, what I need is to touch grass and read a book 
And today, when I felt like adding anything else to my life would only overload and overwhelm me, what I really needed was to take on something harder.

If you want something done, ask a busy person

Hey there, you probably already know this, but I am a mechanical engineer currently trying out a pivot to software engineering. There are of course things that I like about software engineering and mechanical engineering, and there are things I don't love about them too. One thing I do miss about mechE is CAD. Something about having everything refer to a physical visual model feels very different than trying to do things in the world of say, embedded firmware, which is what I'm doing an externship in right now. For example, if something needs to be fixed in CAD, you can usually model the problem mentally as either something that needs to physically be changed on the model, something that needs to happen for a manufacturing reason or such, or something to do with constraints or parameters. Or another way to put it is that when I was working on special trackwork for NYC, pretty much every single concept could be explained with math. Still abstract, but able to be broken down into math or physics concepts. In software, there are many similarities to this, but there are also many many more abstractions to deal with, layer upon layer of abstraction, and if you're missing one layer, the next one feels like hieroglyphics. For example, needing to use a different serial library to get our EEG data from our chip to our Arduino to our computer, because FTDI has complications with MacOS - this to me is nowhere, nonexistent on my mental model of what this system looks like. I've run into this a few times in the embedded systems field - sometimes it feels completely foreign and unintuitive to me, and other times I get to see a live graph dashboard of EEG data streaming from my fingertips and I think that this world is amazing. You could say it's just ignorance, that I just need to learn more, but I still want the learning process to be as painless as possible, because I've seen it's possible - then again, you might just be right, I am still early in both software and embedded systems, and even mechE for that matter. And I have prided myself on being a very abstract thinker, and I know I can do it, but all this has just got me thinking about whether I'm in the right place or not. Which got me thinking, the right place for me is likely a balance between the many worlds that I love - software, CAD, game dev, math, etc. I'd like to hear about options - whether they are companies that I might like to work for, job titles that I should pursue, projects that would be interesting for me to work on (bonus if it's something I can do during this bootcamp), entire fields/industries, etc.  I want to know what lies at the intersection of CAD, software engineering, game dev, and math. 


You're not in the wrong place, you're at a crossroads
