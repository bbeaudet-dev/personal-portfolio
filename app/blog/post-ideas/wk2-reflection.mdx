Life doesn’t come with an instruction manual, and neither does managing your own mind. It took me a long time to realize that the problems we encounter as humans are not often "one-and-done"s. That's why whenever I get to the other side of a struggle, I feel like I have it licked, like I found the manual to my mind, like I've finally cracked the code. Last week, I talked about what it meant to truly face myself and work through some difficult emotions, which eventually left me feeling pretty triumphant. Alas, I am here again to report that working through these feelings was not a "one-and-done" and that learning to live gracefully with myself is an ongoing project.

### Discerning

The ecstasy of revelation can feel wonderful, but it can also be blinding - e.g. me thinking all of my problems have been spontaneously solved. This blindness typically ends with some kind of great "disillusioning", where you are forced to confront the reality of the situation, often painfully.

On the other hand, learning new things about yourself and the world really is like _cracking the code of life_, and it's often in these moments of lucidity that I gain the power of **discernment**, of seeing the future, of suddenly knowing whether the path I'm on is the right path for me. Despite the risk of blindness and disillusionment, there's a lot of power to be had there. I believe some of the most important decisions are made on gut feelings, on intuition, on relying on our discernment of whether our actions and environment align with the highest possible versions of ourselves.

More pragmatically, discernment is good for **making plans for the future**. If I know deep down that I'm in the wrong place, then I should consider quitting (e.g. leaving the bootcamp) - on the other hand, if I know in my soul that I am exactly where I need to be, I can use that to make plans for finding new drives or capitalizing on my determination to find success. 

### Destiny

I've never been a major proponent of _destiny_, or at least the canonical interpretation, but I do believe that too often ignoring these intuitions, these times of discernment, these voices from the deepest parts of our being, will eventually and inevitably lead to that part of ourselves getting drowned out. When we can no longer hear or heed the voice of our soul, we close off the path of manifesting our true selves.

One of my favorite books is [_The Alchemist_ by Paulo Coelho](https://www.elizabethrider.com/why-everyone-should-read-the-alchemist/) (credit to Parth for showing me originally). It's my most-highlighted book by far, sometimes with entire pages covered in yellow, pink, and blue highlighter, and I discover new meaning each time I read it. To drive home the idea of "ignoring your inner voice", here is an excerpt about the protagonist facing a choice between a) continuing to pursue the treasure that he gave up everything for or b) giving up his dreams to stay with the woman that he has fallen in love with:

> "You want to give up the treasure that you set out to find? Okay. Here’s how it’ll unfold. You will let go of the treasure and marry her. The first year will be amazing: you will be the councillor and everyone will respect you; your partner will be really happy. Then second year, you’ll sometimes think about the treasure that awaits you, but you won’t be able to talk to your partner otherwise they’ll feel guilty that they didn’t encourage you. The third year you’ll start missing it more, doubting yourself. So you’ll go on long walks trying to hide your emotions from your partner, but they’ll know something’s wrong. The fourth year will see endless arguments. Your work will suffer and you’ll feel you’re constantly playing catch up. You’ll frantically search for things to do to keep your work going well but things will be chaotic. The fifth year will be filled with regret beyond your control.

I could easily write a novel's-worth on aligning with your true self, destiny, etc., but that's obviously not the part that I struggle with or I wouldn't be writing this post. The part I struggle with, and the part that is _not inherently present in the fleeting ecstasy of revelation_, is the _carrying out of any plan resulting from this discernment_. In other words, making plans is easy - living them out day after day is hard, especially when life drags you down and you lose sight of that original inspiration. [This meme](screw the plan) perfectly describes how my brain responds to these moments. 

### Why am I here?

I know I'm in the right place. My first week here gave me that discernment. I am not quitting from the bootcamp. I am doubled down on my commitment and determination. However, that doesn't automatically stop me from having bad days, from continuing to doubt myself, from losing sight of the drive that I felt so strongly at one point - and it's no secret that carrying out plans handily just isn't one of my strongsuits.




which is probably why I continue to persuade myself that I've cracked the code, despite experiencing the same pattern many times over.

Every time I work through something uncomfortable, I catch myself thinking I’ve “solved” it, that it won’t come back again. But it always does.
