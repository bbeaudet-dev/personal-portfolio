First day in New York, driving home from airport:
Writing topic: Life is a series of games, untrivial games, there are importantly games. I know I’ve written about something similar before. Treat life like a video game. Subnautica, a whole world to explore, things to build, knowledge to gain, techniques to practice, new tools to build and learn how to wield unlocking new abilities, it’s the same, there is a whole world out there waiting for you to explore.


On completeness: adderall is one of the only medications that biologically “fixes” the problem it’s addressing, rather than treating the symptoms. Which is amazing. Amazing that that even exists, the need for such a thing I mean, amazing that we discovered it, amazing that we made it, and amazing that it helps. The only flip side, as you know I love my flip sides - is that it can often make you feel incomplete when you don’t have it. And i don’t think there’s any label to this kind of dichotomy. It’s not “terrible” that I feel incomplete without something that I need. And it’s not “great” that I can feel complete with it. Or maybe it’s both, but for some reason I’m more inclined to just say “it is”. So it goes.


For a long time I just wanted to feel good, and I would tell myself all kinds of stories other than the truth about myself.
If there was one question that I could ask God, if there's one fundamental question that's occupied my brain more than any other, it's this: Why do humans do things that we know are bad for us? Why is it so difficult to see the thing that would be good for us, yet so easy for others? 
Is it just a skill issue? 
Are people with high EQ able to easily spot what would be good for someone with low EQ? And is it only low EQ people that are unable to easily see what is good for them?

Breaking out of "pick me" mode


How do I describe this feeling that I get after writing for an extended period? I think what it comes down to is being able to jump back into life. Writing is just like making a plan: you can make as good of a plan as you want, but nothing happens until you ENACT the plan, you do something about the plan, you take action, you jump in. And I think when I get too far into the writing rabbit hole, I just want to dig deeper, and I think I'm going to run into gold eventually, but it turns out you need to go the opposite direction, you have to jump back into life. Because as amazing as writing makes me feel, it does take me out of life, it's a third person view.
