The goal is not just that you complete all of the specs of the program
Like there's no need for "going back"
Like oh Ben found that he really likes embedded systems, but he's behind on his bootcamp stuff
Like no, if you find something that you really love, just do it bro
There is not one pathway to success in this program. You get to make your own
And it's going to look different for different people
Like why do you feel the compulsion to come back and do everything that the program tells you to do when you've ALREADY GOTTEN the desired outcome?
