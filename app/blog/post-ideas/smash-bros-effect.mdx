I've played video games my whole life, which has undeniably shaped how I move through the world as an adult—how I learn, process information, and make connections. My brain naturally gravitates toward gaming metaphors to understand complex concepts, and sometimes these analogies reveal profound truths about life.


### Creative Mode vs. Survival Mode

Take Minecraft. I spent countless hours in both creative mode (infinite resources, no consequences) and survival mode (limited resources, real stakes). In creative mode, I could build massive mansions and elaborate farms instantly. But I never felt fully satisfied with these creations because I was taking shortcuts, convincing myself I would have put in the work "if I had the time."

This same mindset crept into my real life, especially with money. I'd be conscious about spending 75% of the time, but then my instinct would kick in—like switching to creative mode, buying whatever I wanted, then switching back to "survival mode" and pretending nothing happened. Obviously, real life doesn't have cheat codes. I was bleeding money fast.

But recognizing this pattern through the Minecraft lens made everything click. Just like building a mansion in creative mode left me feeling empty, taking financial shortcuts left me unfulfilled. The most rewarding Minecraft experiences were simple survival mode achievements—and the same applied to money management. Understanding the value of money wasn't just about discipline; it was about choosing to live in "survival mode" where efforts have real weight and consequences.


### The Power of Analogous Worlds

Malcolm Gladwell talks about "analogous worlds"—using insights from one domain to understand another. This is exactly what gaming metaphors do for me. Video games link to personal finance, puzzle-solving connects to engineering, and mastering any skill teaches you how to master others.

Reality is full of overlapping worlds. A true master isn't just good at one thing—they understand concepts that appear across multiple domains. Learning to be excellent at anything leads to insights in seemingly unrelated areas.

This realization freed me from a paralyzing dilemma I'd faced for years: Which path should I choose? Engineering? Psychology? Philosophy? Entrepreneurship? I was frozen by the fear of choosing wrong and forever regretting not achieving my dreams.

But here's what I learned: Your dreams aren't about which specific path you take—they're about your decision to commit to a path. You can't think your way into the life you want. You need to pick the best option available, knowing you can always switch if something better emerges. And switching doesn't mean starting from scratch, because learning is universal.


### The Smash Bros. Revelation

This brings me to the insight that changed everything: the Smash Bros. effect.

I played Super Smash Bros. casually for years before joining my college's competitive scene. I was never great, but I learned something crucial about mastery that applies far beyond gaming.

The key insight was this: You need to master controlling your own character first, building it into autopilot, so you can focus on what your opponent is doing. Imagine driving while only looking at your own hood instead of the road—you'd never navigate traffic successfully. Yet this is exactly how most people approach competition and life.

When you're constantly thinking about your own technique, your own movements, your own performance, you have no mental bandwidth left to observe patterns, anticipate others' moves, or develop real strategy. The magic happens when you've practiced your fundamentals enough that they become automatic, freeing your mind to engage with the bigger picture.


### From Gaming to Squash to Life

This insight first clicked for me in squash. I realized I was so focused on my swing technique and shot quality that I wasn't watching my opponent at all. Once I developed enough muscle memory to trust my basic strokes, I could start observing my opponent's patterns, anticipating their shots, and playing strategically rather than just hitting the ball around.

But the principle extends far beyond sports. In any field, you need to develop systems and habits that become automatic, freeing up mental energy for higher-level thinking. In relationships, you need to master basic communication and emotional regulation so you can focus on truly understanding your partner. In work, you automate routine tasks so you can tackle creative problems.

The broader lesson: Build your autopilot in the fundamentals, then use that freedom to engage with complexity.


### The Character-Switching Trap

Smash Bros. taught me another crucial lesson about persistence versus pivoting. When I was frustrated with a character, I'd often switch to a new one, thinking that would solve my problems. It never did. The same obstacles would emerge with every character because the real issue wasn't the character—it was my approach to overcoming challenges.

I see this pattern everywhere now. Frustrated with piano? Switch to drums. Struggling with reading? Go back to video games. Relationship hitting a rough patch? Maybe we're just incompatible. Job getting difficult? Time to find a new career.

The rush of novelty when starting something new can be intoxicating, convincing us that switching was the right choice. But often, we're just avoiding the discomfort of pushing through plateaus and developing our weaknesses.

This doesn't mean never switching—sometimes you genuinely are playing the wrong character or pursuing the wrong path. The key is being honest about your motivations. Are you switching because you've discovered something genuinely better suited to you, or are you just running from difficulty?


### The Growth Mindset in Practice

The most rewarding achievements come from sticking with discomfort and deliberately strengthening your weaknesses rather than switching characters. Whether it's a challenging subject in your major, a difficult period in a relationship, or a plateau in your hobby—the question isn't always "How do I get out of this?" but "What can I learn from this?"

Life isn't about eliminating problems; it's about choosing which set of problems you're willing to live with and then committing every cell in your body to growing through them.

Sometimes the lesson is persistence. Sometimes it's knowing when to pivot. The difference lies in whether you're making decisions from a place of growth or from a place of avoidance.


### The Autopilot Paradox

Here's the beautiful paradox: The better you get at anything, the less conscious effort it requires. Masters make things look effortless not because they're not trying, but because they've automated the fundamentals so completely that they can focus entirely on the aspects that truly matter.

Whether you're playing Smash Bros., hitting a squash ball, managing money, or navigating a relationship, the principle remains the same: Master your character first, then play the larger game.

And remember—in life, unlike in video games, your character is completely unique. There's no one else with your exact combination of strengths, weaknesses, experiences, and perspectives. Learning to play your character well isn't about copying someone else's strategy; it's about developing your own unique style while staying fundamentally grounded in proven principles.

The game never ends, but that's what makes it beautiful. There's always another level to reach, another skill to develop, another way to grow. The key is enjoying the process of mastery itself, not just the destinations it leads to.

Sometimes the most profound life lessons come from the most unexpected places. Who knew that getting bodied in Smash Bros. would teach me about focus, persistence, and the nature of expertise itself?

The student is ready; the teacher appears. Sometimes that teacher is a video game.
