It's interesting to think about the question: if you were to put the whole universe into a data structure like an array, what would it look like?

Ok so we're down a rabbit hole of just one facet of the universe. How do you describe its noise? Sound bites? Numbers? 
What about its body? Measurements? Models? 

https://jwt.io/introduction - this made me think that "software engineering deals with the world of information"
And I like that. It makes me think I'm in the right place. Because when I think about what I really want to do in this world, what is truly a valuable thing, at the end of the day, it boils down to just being with good people, good times, etc.
It's why I love writing, because I get to make an impact in the world through my ideas. And of course preparing food and building houses is extremely valuable, but ideas have always been the thing that I've wanted to "monetize" or capitalize on, fulfill my destiny, etc.

And I guess what I'm trying to say is that data is very interesting to me right now. We have found ways to break up ideas and information into various "physical", or at least visual mediums. And then we can build real things with those mediums and with that data. 

At the VERY least, I connect more with this concept than with the idea of building railroads, or even medical devives, and I think that's because it's more direct. That's something that has driven me ever since college when I discovered my true motivations. I want to see, feel, be close to the impact that I have. It's why I loved building medical devices in London, because I got to see the patients' responses when they got to use our device. It's why I love writing and having great conversations with people. And it's why I felt disconnected when working on railroads. 
(I posted that article about being on a rock somewhere right? Repost it here?)

And while there is definitely some separation, i.e. the computer, I don't know if that's what matters. I think it's less about physically seeing / proximity to the impact than it is how many intermediaries are between me and the user, whether people or "transfers" or conversions. When I pass on an egnineering drawing, it goes to the manufacturing shop and the operators use it to create the physical product. In some ways, that is where the thing that I built ends. But in another sense, the thing that I made has now been physically manifested, which is dope. I dentify with the latter, at least at this point in the pipeline. Once it's created, we pack it up and/or assemble it with other pieces and send it to the customer. The customer then installs it into their trackwork system. Great, here's another "endpoint", the user now has and is using the product that I designed. Still, pretty cool. When I'm on the subway, I can think "we are currently traveling on components that I helped design, and I can get a nonzero amount of inspiration and wonder from this. That lasted a year or two. The joy of seeing the thing I designed physcially manifested did not get old, and hasn't really yet. Anyways, then the trains travel on those components, trains that are carrying the good people of NYC, carrying my family and friends, etc. And that's cool to think about too. But then again, I didn't help design the majority of the rails, the train, signaling, i.e. 99.9% of the actual system. So my "conversion rate" between what I built and what manufested in the world is like 0.1%
Whereas, when I was working as a pizza cook, I think that number was much higher. Of course I can always be more biased and say things like "well you didn't grow the wheat that made the dough", but my initial thought there is that it matters how things are used only moving forward. I also did not roll the steel into the rails that I used, or design the rail sections I'm using. Sure, maybe it's worth looking into this as an element of how we experience fulfillment and competence, but I'm inclined to say that it doesn't factor into the conversion rate too much, at least the Ben to customer rate, maybe there is another rate that is conception to realization. (see next paragraph about Parth and flower computer) I have dough, sauce, and cheese, and I make pizzas that hungry customers eat, right out of the oven while it's hot. That pizza is their main course of the meal, and probably their main meal of the day, and maybe the one tme they decide to go out that week. And that one time a week makes them happy, it's something to look forward to. I'm finding it difficult to be pessimistic about the conversion rate of pizza. Sure, someone else puts some finishing touches on it, and then they put it on a plate or whatever, and the wait staff takes it out to the customer, but I'm inclined to say that the conversion rate is probably north of 50%. It's a more contained system than railroad components. And so maybe this feeling just comes from that, a difference in scope, which is totally nomral and fine and nothing "wrng" with that. 

(this could be a fun prompt for Parth and flower computer, like how far along are you from conception to realization? Or how complex is your string of things needed to make you exist? Or what is the smmallest complete thing that you are a part of?) This could get really REALLY complex really fast. It's almost mathematical. What does completeness mean? What frame of referecnce are we using when examining what the thing is a part of, what makes it up, where it is on the path to realization. How do humans perceive these concepts, and is it different from objective? Does objective exist in this case? 
And once I get this far into the conversation, I realize that you can go infinitely deep in either direction. It's turtles all the way down. 
And that is both impractical and mindbogglingly beautiful. Impractical because us humans like to design "perfect" systems in an imperfect world, we like to fully cateogirze and quantify things so that we can write rules and algorithms and have structure and predicted outcomes. And the concept of infinnity doesn't really fit well into that. Laws are a great example. There is no ideal set of laws that exist in Utopia, there is only which level of complexity you decide is a generally good level to draw the line. But as we see, that line often moves around, is different for different concepts, and our capacity as humanity evolves too. It means that we have to put a lot of work and thought into where we want to draw that line. And it's always going to feel like moving goalposts, and that's because it is. And that is often how SWE feels, moreso than mechanical engineering. We know pretty well how gravity and friction and inertia work, so we can draw the line pretty clearly when we create standards for railroad specifications. There is a lot of buffer, because really the next point where our conception of physical laws start to break down is in distant galaxies, at temperatures close to the sun, traveling at light speed, near a black hole, etc. 
On the other hand, the lines that we have drawn when it comes to software and data are less clear, and are much closer to breakdown points. Whereas none of us will ever travel at light speed, be on the surface of the sun, or fall into a black hole in our lifetimes (hopefully), any one of us is capable of organizing information, thinking in a new way, presenting data in a way that breaks our previous conceptions and require us to draw a new line. And that's beautiful. Because we're dealing with information, philosophy, data, logic, ones and zeroes, inputs and outputs. These things can be volatile. 
The limits of our knowledge systems are much more easily broken
But it's also beautiful, because it means that we are part of a world that is bigger than us, bigger than the biggest thing we can possibly imagine, let alone classify into neat little data sttuctures. 
It reminds me of a cool app too. Universe?
The good people at ___ make it possible to see just how fluid these lines that we draw are, and how difficult it still is for our brain to comprehend the scale of the universe. 
And so it goes with many concepts in SWE, we must build abstraction on top of abstraction on top of abstraction, many of which liekly exist because we needed a new way to draw a new line on top of an existing framework, we must grapple everyday with the concept of infinity, of granularity, we must confront the black hole, we need ot know what it feels like to fly too close to the sun, we need to go to the depths of the ocean. To move forward in software, we need to metaphorically break the laws of physics, we need to imagine what it would be like to travel at the speed of light, we must philosophize about systems and possibilities that are much larger than ourselves.

Well, to get to what I was saying, building things with code, with logic, with applied philosophy, as opposed to following railroad specifications, has made me feel more connected to the world, and I'm able to bring more of my full self into the work that I do. And of course that's not to knock anything or say that anything is the "best", as I just said there isn't really objective anything considering the infinite spectrum of perspective. It just means that I'm happy, and happy to be happy. Happy to be in a better place than yesterday. Happy to be chasing destiny. 

All of this boils down to the question of:
What actually matters?

All of it, everything is so fragile, yet also so interconnected and unbreakable. But right now it feels particularly fragile. Building cool little apps isn't quite as important if your country is currently expereinceing a hostile fascist takeover, for example. When things are especially fragile, it requires different skills, different people, we need heroes to step up, martyrs to die for causes, people to die fighting for what they believe in. So if software engineering helps me stay connected to the world, gets me to write, etc. then it resonates with me a lot deeper, because even if the world goes to hell, I can still do things and be valuable. I can use my words as both weappons to fight the enemy, to shelter the weak, to warm people by a fire, and to remind people of what is important in life. That's a hell of a lot better than telling people about railroads during the apocalypse. And of course I'm being pessimistic, but I do mean it. 
Reminds me of a song I really love, a few lines in particular "when the apocalypse is over, I hope you like your job". "Ain't it a shame nobody sets anybody free anymore."



Ask ChatGPT to help noodle on this concept of a conversion rate
- I do like the analogy of light speed / black hole etc. could you find a way to build that in? 
- They also kinda nixed the whole drawing the line thing, which I think is actually cool

Can one sentence capture all of life?

That’s the premise of Lucy Ellmann’s 2019 novel Ducks, Newburyport—a 1,000+ page book written as a single, flowing sentence of over 426,000 words. It spirals through motherhood, memory, mortality, the American Midwest, and the quiet hum of daily life—anchored by the phrase “the fact that,” repeated more than 19,000 times. I’ve only read a few pages of it (for now), but even a short dive is enough to evoke a powerful feeling: that the universe we live in is made up of too much. And yet somehow, we manage to live in it anyway. And build things in it.

A few days before I started Fractal's AI Accelerator, I built a Pokédex app from scratch - just a list of Pokemon on a screen, a text input for registering new Pokemon, and a dropdown for sorting by type. I always considered Pokemon a relatively "simple" game - just Pokémon names, stats, types, some sprites, and a map to walk around. But beneath that? Dozens of data types, deeply nested objects, asynchronous fetch calls, name variants, evolutions, localizations, IDs that differ depending on context… It’s like trying to recreate a fractal from memory.
