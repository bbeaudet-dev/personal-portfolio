## Can a single sentence capture all of life?

That's the premise of Lucy Ellmann's 2019 novel *Ducks, Newburyport*—a 1,000+ page book written as a single, flowing sentence of over 426,000 words. It spirals through motherhood, memory, mortality, the American Midwest, and the quiet hum of daily life—anchored by the phrase "the fact that," repeated more than 19,000 times. I've only read a few pages of it (for now), but even a short dive is enough to evoke a powerful feeling: that the universe we live in is larger than we can ever imagine, larger than life. And yet somehow, we manage to live in it anyway. And build things in it.

A few days before I started Fractal's AI Accelerator, I built a Pokédex app from scratch - just a list of Pokemon on a screen, a text input for registering new Pokemon, and a dropdown for sorting by type. I always considered Pokemon a relatively "simple" game - just Pokémon names, stats, types, some sprites, and a map to walk around. But beneath that? Dozens of data types, deeply nested objects, asynchronous fetch calls, name variants, evolutions, localizations, IDs that differ depending on context, and ALL of that across 9+ generations of differeneces… It's like trying to recreate a fractal from memory.

### Visible Information

This got me thinking about something Parth keeps telling me: "software engineering is applied philosophy." At first, it might seem like hyperbole that anyone might say about their field, and while there may be some truth to that, I've come to realize just how many fundamental questions we grapple with every day:  How do we represent truth in data? What does it mean for something to exist in a system? How should we structure information? What relationships matter? Every architectural decision is really a philosophical stance about how systems work within the world.

This is why I feel more at home in this field. When I think about what I truly want to do—what feels genuinely valuable—it boils down to sharing ideas and making an impact through thought and creativity. Software lets me build with ideas themselves.

Data fascinates me because we've found ways to break up ideas and information into visual, manipulable mediums. We can build real things with that data. There's something compelling about working directly with thoughts and concepts, turning abstract ideas into systems that people actually use.

## Conversion Rates

This connects to something I've been thinking about: the "conversion rate" between what I build and what manifests in the world. When I worked on railroad trackwork, my engineering drawings went to manufacturing shops, got built into physical products, shipped to customers, installed into trackwork systems, and eventually carried trains full of New Yorkers. Cool to think about, sure. But my actual contribution? Maybe 0.1% of what passengers experience when riding those trains.

Compare that to when I worked as a pizza cook. I had dough, sauce, and cheese, and I made pizzas that hungry customers enjoyed straight out of the oven. Aside from quality checks and finishing touches, the thing that I made shipped straight to the customer to be enjoyed. 

Software engineering sits much closer to the pizza-making end of the spectrum. When I build an app that helps someone organize their thoughts or find information, there are fewer intermediaries between my work and their experience. The computer itself is an intermediary, but it's not like the manufacturing shop, shipping department, installation crew, and transit system that stood between my railroad drawings and actual human impact.

## Abstractions All the Way Down

But here's where software gets beautifully complex: we're dealing with abstraction on top of abstraction on top of abstraction. In mechE and physics, we know pretty well how gravity, friction, and inertia work. We can draw clearer lines when creating standards because the next "breakdown point" is in distant galaxies, near black holes, traveling at light speed—places none of us will ever experience.

In software, the lines we've drawn are much closer to breakdown points - a new JavaScript framework might make your entire codebase feel obsolete overnight. Any of us is capable of organizing information in a new way, presenting data that breaks our previous conceptions and requires us to draw new boundaries. The limits of our knowledge systems are much more easily broken. And that's both challenging and beautiful.

To move forward in software, we need to metaphorically *break the laws of physics*. We need to imagine traveling at the speed of light, philosophize about systems much larger than ourselves, grapple with concepts of infinity and granularity. We must build frameworks knowing they'll need to be rebuilt, create order knowing it's temporary.

## The Infinite Data Structure

So back to that original question: if you were to put the whole universe into a data structure, what would it look like? 

Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species, CommonName... and we're already down a rabbit hole of just one facet. How do you describe its noise? Its movement? Its thoughts and dreams and late-night conversations?

The truth is, it's turtles all the way down. Infinite complexity in every direction. And that's both impractical—we humans like to design "perfect" systems in an imperfect world—and mind-bogglingly beautiful. Because it means we're part of something bigger than the biggest thing we can imagine, let alone classify into neat little data structures.

Maybe that's why I'm drawn to this work. Not because I can capture all of life in a single sentence or data structure, but because in trying, in building these abstractions and tools and apps, I get to wrestle with infinity every day. I get to be part of humanity's ongoing attempt to make sense of too much universe, one API call at a time.

And somehow, we manage to live in it anyway. And build things in it.



## What Actually Matters?

This brings me to the deeper question that's been driving this reflection: What actually matters?

Everything feels simultaneously fragile and unbreakable. Building cool little apps isn't quite as important if your country is experiencing upheaval, for example. But if software engineering helps me stay connected to the world, gets me writing, thinking, building—then it resonates much deeper. Even if things fall apart, I can still use words as weapons to fight, as shelter for the weak, as warmth by the fire, as reminders of what's important in life.

That feels like a hell of a lot better preparation than talking about railroad specifications during uncertain times.


How far along are you from conception to realization? Or how complex is your string of things needed to make you exist? Or what is the smmallest complete thing that you are a part of?) This could get really REALLY complex really fast. It's almost mathematical. What does completeness mean? What frame of referecnce are we using when examining what the thing is a part of, what makes it up, where it is on the path to realization. How do humans perceive these concepts, and is it different from objective? Does objective exist in this case? 
And once I get this far into the conversation, I realize that you can go infinitely deep in either direction. It's turtles all the way down. 
And that is both impractical and mindbogglingly beautiful. Impractical because us humans like to design "perfect" systems in an imperfect world, we like to fully cateogirze and quantify things so that we can write rules and algorithms and have structure and predicted outcomes. And the concept of infinnity doesn't really fit well into that. Laws are a great example. There is no ideal set of laws that exist in Utopia, there is only which level of complexity you decide is a generally good level to draw the line. But as we see, that line often moves around, is different for different concepts, and our capacity as humanity evolves too. It means that we have to put a lot of work and thought into where we want to draw that line. And it's always going to feel like moving goalposts, and that's because it is.




All of it, everything is so fragile, yet also so interconnected and unbreakable. But right now it feels particularly fragile. Building cool little apps isn't quite as important if your country is currently expereinceing a hostile fascist takeover, for example. When things are especially fragile, it requires different skills, different people, we need heroes to step up, martyrs to die for causes, people to die fighting for what they believe in. So if software engineering helps me stay connected to the world, gets me to write, etc. then it resonates with me a lot deeper, because even if the world goes to hell, I can still do things and be valuable. I can use my words as both weappons to fight the enemy, to shelter the weak, to warm people by a fire, and to remind people of what is important in life. That's a hell of a lot better than telling people about railroads during the apocalypse. And of course I'm being pessimistic, but I do mean it. 
Reminds me of a song I really love, a few lines in particular "when the apocalypse is over, I hope you like your job". "Ain't it a shame nobody sets anybody free anymore."
