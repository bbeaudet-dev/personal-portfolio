### The realization of infinite possibility

Although I only "officially" started learning to code a few months ago, I spent all of 2024 learning Visual Basic and applying it to everything from automating CAD models with iLogic and building project management / data analysis tools at work, to organizing our wedding planning and generating floor plans of houses. As useful as these projects may or may not be, my primary motivator (for coding and generally in life too) has been an inner-childlike fascination with...
the world of possibilities that greeted me after taking the first steps into the world of software engineering. 

I had the drive to become a competent engineer not just because it would make me more employable, but because I wanted to solve meaningful problems - and the only way to do that was by learning whatever new concepts were needed to do the job. No textbooks or online courses - just a dream, some online forums, and an insatiable appetite for getting my coding experiments to work and make a real impact. 

While learning to code is likely already comparable to learning a new language, learning to do so in the context of things I already knew how to do, like designing something in CAD or managing data in Excel, opened my eyes to a whole world of language that I didn't know existed. It made me realize that my conception of how computers worked was akin to the way some people conclude something could only be the work of magic, witchcraft, or wizardry - or, another example, like when people think electricity simply comes from "the wall". 

Consequently, my belief about what was possible with computers was also severely limited / tunnel-visioned - I essentially believed that "the limit of what I can do depends on what the software / UI allows me to do", but by pulling back the curtain, that belief transformed into "everything I currently do on the computer is actually running on the same language of code - what I can build with computers and code is infinite". 


### Taking the leap

I was giddy. I was excited to get up early in the morning, get to work, code, and then come home late. To the degree that I could hardly even get myself to do my job anymore - all I wanted to do was come up with new tools that would help us be more efficient and do things in new ways, learn new programming concepts, and build those tools. Sure, I was helping the company/team in other ways by building these tools, but the amount of time that I was spending coding and learning new concepts grew and grew, until the amount of projects that I had in the works was enough to fill a full-time job (or more, as I became the manager for teams of engineers on several projects). 
Some aspects were great - I got to spend time on things that I was suddenly very passionate about, which were giving me new skills and opening up new opportunities, I was getting paid well, and I was taking on a lot more responsibility, and being verbally recognized for it.
However, the only problem was that they still expected me to put in the standard 45 hours of design work (not coding), as that was still my job. Working on these new projects didn't feel like I was "shirking my duties" - the company is in an ancient industry, and had failed to stay up to date on design methods and technology, and thus much of the work we did was tedious, repetitive, inefficient, and behind the times. Our team had been so jam-packed for the last year that we had no time for any new trainings or to upgrade the technologies/methods we were using. And it seemed like anytime our load lightened up a little bit, the purchasing department would think that we were short on work and put out a ton of new bids on new orders, or we would take on projects from other plants. 
So, in my eyes, me learning to program and designing new systems/tools for our team felt much MORE important and crucial to our success than sticking to my job description did. 
When the workload of these new projects hit 20+ hours a week, I asked if we could build all of these new responsibilities into my JD - and salary. I sat down with my manager and his boss to talk about the work I'd been doing, and they concluded that, while beneficial to the company, they couldnt do anything about it yet.  The outlook was actually good, it seemed, but for now, it would have to be on your own time, they would not pay me for it, and I was still expected to take on a full workload of my JD responsibilities.
Then, a particularly busy stretch hit us. There was no longer any time to code or work on extracurricular projects. At that point, I had glimpsed the other side, I had tasted the sweet nectar, I had bathed in the fountain of youth, the something of pleasure - I knew that this was what I wanted to do, and I still saw the opportunities at this company, if we could just get past this hurdle of inefficiency. Throughout the next few months of doing work that was repetitive, arduous, and inefficient, and KNOWING that a better way was out there (and that our competition was already ahead of us), I felt my drive disappear.
I tried to find the same drive for my job that I had during the first 6 months, but it was too late, and there was no going back for me - I knew that staying in this job, being held back from the projects that I most wanted to pioneer, and no longer spending time learning to code and build things would only make me more and more depressed.
So, after a year and a half at the company, 9 months of asking for my job description to reflect my actual responsibilities, and a few too many weeks spent wallowing in my own perceived misery, I quit. No job lined up, no courses or classes, just a clear picture of what I was leaving behind for good and a vague vision of where this newfound passion might take me.


### Funemployed

I wish I could say that quitting my job solved my problems, or that having an extra 10 hours each day meant that I would learn coding super quickly. Truth is, the lack of structure (and possibly some of the after effects of being depressed/angry at work for so long) knocked me onto my ass.
I spent a few weeks dredging my way through parts 0 and 1 of Fullstack Open, but felt that I wasn't understanding it very well (like everything was going over my head, like I was already supposed to know what all these things are they're talking about) and lost interest. I spent the next few weeks going down a Pokemon ROM hack rabbit hole, learning how to parse through the massive amount of code and even change things to create your own game. Again, this was amazing and I'm super interested in it, but it again felt like it was above my skill/paygrade. 
Then I spent a few weeks doing not that much at all, playing Balatro, Opus Magnum. 
All the while, I had been waffling on the idea of doing a bootcamp, and which one. Finally I stopped waffling and made the decision to do Fractal, and it was like a massive weight was lifted from my shoulders and from my motivation. I suddenly knew exactly what I needed to do and I was driven to do it again by that feverish intensity that coding can give me. 
I made my way through the Scrimba courses on HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and the other pre-course materials.
Today, I finally came back to fullstack open, and so many things make so much more sense now, and I have my passion back. 


### The drive to become a competent engineer

The past few days have reminded me of the beauty and fulfillment of being a competent engineer. When I'm depressed or unmotivated and try to learn something new, I get annoyed that whatever it is isn't the way that I expected/wanted/understand it to be. Learning a new trade feels like a monumental chore/drag, and I think that partly comes from my desire to want things to "feel easy", or get in a flow state. I knew flow states came often when I was learning to code at first, but I couldn't get out of this funk where every new thing felt like a chore. Different function/prop/createElement notations/ways of accomplishing the same thing, made me feel like I would never understand enough to be competent. 
However, today was different. The last few days have been different. 
I'm back in the growth/learning flow. Running into obstacles prompts me to be curious rather than frustrated. I feel driven to become a competent engineer.
And that's important to me for another reason: one of the "themes" throughout my life, motifs that continue to pop up, has been that I'm a jack of all trades. I'm athletic, smart, funny, creative, energetic. I love puzzles, sudoku, games, hiking, volleyball, kickball, hockey, squash, cooking, coding, writing, LEGOs, board games, etc.  But I've never been GREAT at any one thing in particular. It seems as though I always get to the "good" point very early on, but then struggle to make it to "great" - usually because I find a new thing to become "good" at (typical ADHD novelty). 


### A time to diverge, a time to converge

Now is the time to converge, to narrow, to zoom in, use the microscope.
Quitting my job gave me an opportunity to diverge, widen my view, zoom out, use the telescope, maybe even to a fault.
Now is the time to commit myself to something and do everything in my power to become great at it. It's time to learn, to grow, to be taught, to welcome obstacles and find ways through or around them, to accept challenges.

Field notes 001 - becoming a better engineer
"wide range of skills" - contradicts that you can't be a jack of all trades and a competent engineer!
What does competent mean? being able to solve the problems that you are presented with and want to solve? To make the world a better place, or just your life?
Producing an output everyday, something to point to and say "I did that!" - this ties in with something else I just saw, ADHD success insomnia, where we immediately forget the things we just accomplished and therefore feel as though we've accomplished nothing. To combat this, track your progress and your successes, big or small. 


### Recent learnings

Since Balatro has been one of my recent obsessions, one of my favorite mini-projects so far has been the Blackjack application. The Scrimba version is pretty basic and lacks some elements of the game, but it's enough to teach some great concepts. Nevertheless, I took it upon myself to improve the application on my own.
High score 
Fade buttons when not usable
Ace functionality
Still to do:
High score local storage?
Have face cards and aces be assigned names, not just numbers
Have cards be drawn from an actual deck, not just random number 1-13
Multiplayer?
I spent at least a couple hours scouring google for how to change object opacity and trying out different functions/code until I got it to work exactly how I wanted, and I felt so proud of myself. I was actually quite surprised when I got the Ace 1/11 functionality to work (mostly). Seemed too good to be true, and getting both of these things to work made me realize that there are definitely better ways to do some things - but I'm again excited to learn those ways, not frustrated that there's not just one right answer. I think I might've broken every single rule of pure functional programming and minimizing side effects, but I built something that I'm proud of and I'm one step closer to becoming a competent engineer.

function notation
npm run dev - separate build environment

Until next time,
Ben B.
