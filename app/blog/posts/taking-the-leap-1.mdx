### Expanding Possibilities

Although I only "officially" started learning to code a few months ago, I spent all of 2024 learning Visual Basic and applying it to everything from automating CAD models with iLogic and building project management tools at work, to organizing some of our wedding planning and generating floor plans of houses. As useful as these projects may (or may not) be, my primary motivator has always been an inner-childlike fascination with building cool things. 

When I was a kid it was LEGOs. After that came Minecraft, which was essentially "infinite LEGOs in a world made entirely out of LEGOs". When I realized no one was going to pay me for playing Minecraft, I discovered CAD and mechanical design engineering, which was essentially "hey you can keep building whatever your heart desires, but then we can actually create it in real life, and people will actually pay you for it." 

Put another way, I guess it's possible to view the expansion of each of our individual worldviews like the Industrial Revolutions; some new breakthrough leads to swathes of new possibilities, opportunities, and better quality of life. It just so happens that we entered the Fourth Industrial Revolution in 2016 (or at least [a couple smart people say we did](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Industrial_Revolution)), which describes "rapid technological advancement in the 21st century", especially pertaining to "the joining of technologies like artificial intelligence, gene editing, and advanced robotics, that blur the lines between the physical, digital, and biological worlds."

My "4IR" was initiated when the vast world of computers and software engineering was opened up to me. Learning to code in the context of things I already knew - like designing in CAD or managing data in Excel - opened my eyes to a world I didn't know existed. My conception of how computers worked was like thinking electricity simply comes from "the wall" - I essentially believed that "the limit of what I can do with a computer is whatever the program/UI allows me to do," but by pulling back the curtain, that belief transformed into "everything I do on the computer is actually running on code - what I can build is infinite."


### Taking the Leap

I was giddy. I was excited to get up early, get to work, code, and often ended up coming home late (sorry Sophia). All I wanted to do was learn new programming concepts and build new tools that would help our team be more efficient - to the point that I had a hard time focusing on my actual job responsibilities.

The company is in the old-as-the-hills railroad trackwork industry, and it was my belief (whether or not I was right) that they had failed to keep up with current design methods and technology - and that was even before the recent onset of AI and 4IR tools. Much of our design work was tedious, repetitive, and inefficient. In my eyes, learning to program and designing new systems was much more important than sticking to my job description anyways.

When the workload of these coding projects hit 20+ hours a week, I asked if we could build these responsibilities into my job description and salary. My manager and his boss concluded that while beneficial to the company, they couldn't do anything about it yet. It would have to be on my own time, they wouldn't pay me for it, and I was still expected to take on a full design workload.
Then a particularly busy stretch hit, and there was no longer time to code. I had glimpsed the other side, tasted the sweet nectar - I knew this was what I wanted to do. Throughout the next few months of repetitive work, knowing that a better way existed and that our competition was already ahead of us, I felt my drive disappear.

After a year and a half at the company and 9 months of asking for my job description to reflect my actual responsibilities, I quit. No job lined up, no courses or classes, just a clear picture of what I was leaving behind and a vague vision of where this passion might take me.


### Not So Funemployed

I wish I could say that quitting solved my problems, or that having an extra 10 hours each day meant I'd learn coding super quickly. The lack of structure knocked me on my ass.

Here's the thing: dipping my toes into the world of software engineering through familiar contexts like CAD automation and Excel tools had made me giddy and passionate and driven. But I had a rude awakening about how much there was to learn and how difficult even very simple things are to do correctly when you're starting from scratch.

I spent a few weeks trudging through parts 0 and 1 of Fullstack Open, but felt like everything was going over my head - like I was already supposed to know what they were talking about. I spent the next few weeks going down a Pokemon ROM hack rabbit hole, learning to parse through massive amounts of code. Amazing and interesting, but again felt above my skill level.

Then I spent a few weeks not doing much at all, playing Balatro and Opus Magnum.

All the while, I'd been waffling on the idea of doing a bootcamp, and which one. Finally I stopped waffling and decided on Fractal - it was like a massive weight was lifted from my shoulders and motivation. I suddenly knew exactly what I needed to do and was driven again by that feverish intensity that coding can give me.
I made my way through the Scrimba courses on HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and the other pre-course materials. Today, I finally came back to Fullstack Open, and so many things make sense now. I have my passion back.


### The Drive to Become Competent

The past few days have reminded me of the beauty and fulfillment of being a competent engineer. When I'm depressed or unmotivated and try to learn something new, I get annoyed that it isn't the way I expected or wanted it to be. Learning feels like a monumental chore, partly from my desire for things to "feel easy" or get into flow state.

However, today was different. The last few days have been different. I'm back in the growth/learning flow. Running into obstacles prompts curiosity rather than frustration. I feel driven to become a competent engineer.

And that's important for another reason: one of the themes throughout my life has been that I'm a jack of all trades. I'm athletic, smart, funny, creative, energetic. I love puzzles, games, hiking, volleyball, coding, writing, LEGOs, board games. But I've never been GREAT at any one thing in particular. I always get to the "good" point early on, but struggle to make it to "great" - usually because I find a new thing to become "good" at.


### Convergence

Now is the time to converge, to narrow, to zoom in. Quitting my job gave me an opportunity to diverge and widen my view. Now is the time to commit myself to something and do everything in my power to become great at it. It's time to learn, to grow, to welcome obstacles and find ways through them, to accept challenges.


### Recent Learnings

Since Balatro has been one of my recent obsessions, one of my favorite mini-projects has been the Blackjack application. The Scrimba version is pretty basic, but it's enough to teach great concepts. I took it upon myself to improve the application:

High score tracking
Fade buttons when not usable
Ace functionality (1 or 11)

Still to do:

High score local storage
Face cards and aces with names, not just numbers
Cards drawn from an actual deck, not random 1-13
Multiplayer?

I spent at least a couple hours scouring Google for how to change object opacity and trying different functions until I got it to work exactly how I wanted. I felt so proud. I was surprised when I got the Ace 1/11 functionality to work. Getting both of these things working made me realize there are definitely better ways to do some things - but I'm excited to learn those ways, not frustrated that there's not just one right answer.
I think I might've broken every rule of pure functional programming, but I built something I'm proud of and I'm one step closer to becoming a competent engineer.

Until next time,

Ben B.
