## Questions / Thoughts

Could this be considered "putting my priorities in order"? **Or is this just "knowing who I am"**, and now I need to choose how/if I will align my priorities with this list?

**Is the "optimal prioritization" just aligning my goals and to-dos with my list of values?** E.g. if I want to 1) have a good marriage, 2) improve my mental health, and 3) write code and build things: should I prioritize writing code until I'm living out that value satisfactorily, and only then prioritize my mental health? Should I then prioritize my mental health until I'm satisfied with that value, and only then prioritize building a strong marriage? Obviously this is very robotic, but a genuine question is behind it: **How does one prioritize their life in accordance with their values?**

I assume there is some amount of change in values as you go through life, but I believe these **values are generally pretty constant**. The main reason I would see for "drastic" changes would be that I had the wrong idea about what it means to value that thing, e.g. I have suspicions about how much I _value_ leisure time versus how often I use it to _escape_ or find _comfort_.

## Re-Ranking 7/29/25

1. Views on the meaning of suffering
2. Valuing spirituality
3. Views on morality, honesty, integrity
4. Creating things
5. Appreciating beauty in nature, music, etc.
6. Working in a creative environment
7. Valuing love
8. Valuing education, professional, and personal growth
9. Valuing romantic partnerships
10. Valuing mental health
11. Valuing parent, child, and other family relationships
12. Attitudes towards inevitable events such as illness, death, and loss
13. Valuing friendships
14. Valuing physical health
15. Valuing leisure, hobbies, and recreation
16. Valuing a career
17. Valuing charity and volunteering

### Why the changes?

- I will **not** value creating something if I believe it is the wrong thing to do or if I believe it will lead to suffering.
- Maybe I don't feel like an equal partner in marriage yet, but that doesn't mean I don't value romantics partnerships more highly. Valuing things like mental health are important to me particularly because they affect my ability to be a good husband, not because I value it _over_ my romantic partner.
- Like I mentioned in my question above, I don't necessarily _value_ leisure or hobbies super highly - but I do _lean on them_ heavily as a form of escapism. It's an area for growth, especially because it can impact my ability to live out my other values.
