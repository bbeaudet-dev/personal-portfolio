_Week 6 of Fractal Tech's AI Accelerator & Engineering Bootcamp_

## WIP

I consider myself lucky that I spent some time vibe coding _before_ the bootcamp started, and that's because the initial phases of learning what you can do with Cursor or Replit can be intoxicating. Suddenly, _work itself_ no longer burdens you and you are free to simply be a fountain of ideas and dreams, feeding them into the dream-maker and having them instantly come to life with thousands of lines of code. It's like making it rain constantly as you hit accept accept accept accept without even _trying_ to understand what the AI has just added to your codebase.

However, you're bound to run into a big problem, and that problem is that AI is _not generally intelligent_. Humans are generally intelligent beings. Ask it to create an app and boy, it will make that app for you, but ask it to go back and change an existing feature and it suddenly becomes barely functional. AI is all gas and no brakes, forgetting what it created almost as soon as having created it.

This week was the first group project of my bootcamp experience, and I learned that this intoxication from vibe coding can be a huge blocker to team progress.

Another blocker to team progress, at least for beginners like us, is using Git gracefully.
(blockers from Git - rebasing, merge conflicts, starting over, restoring, being nervous to work on anything)

The silver lining of this experience is that I found a niche that I really enjoyed: architecture, system design, data flow, etc.
