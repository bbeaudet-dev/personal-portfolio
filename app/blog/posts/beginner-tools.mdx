_These VS Code extensions are helping me be more productive and find my programming stride._

As a beginner software engineer, I wanted to share the extensions that have genuinely made coding easier and more enjoyable for me. This is by no means an objective or exhaustive list of the "best" tools — just the ones that helped me feel more confident, learn quicker, and get stuff done.

The screenshot below shows a majority of the extensions discussed, including colors, themes, error and bracket lenses, spell check, bookmarks, and to-dos:

## Troubleshooting & Quality of Life

_Catching mistakes early and writing better code_

- **[Error Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens)** - See code errors immediately
- **[Bracket Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wraith13.bracket-lens)** - Know exactly where brackets start and end
- **[Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)** - Catch typos
- **[Headwind](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=heybourn.headwind)** - Sort Tailwind CSS classes
- **[Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)** - CSS auto-completion
- **[Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense)** - Never mistype file paths

### Error Lens

Shows errors and warnings directly on the line where they occur - great for quickly glancing over your code and a QOL must-have.

  className="rounded-lg my-8"
/>

### Bracket Lens

Shows which opening bracket corresponds to each closing bracket with inline info like start/end lines and type of object - great for quickly parsing through nested JavaScript objects. (shown in image above)

### Code Spell Checker

Spell-checks your code comments, strings, and variable names, catching typos that could cause hard-to-track bugs. Not everyone will like this, but I think it provides a good safety net, even if only just for blog posts!

### Tailwind CSS IntelliSense + Headwind

Provides autocomplete, syntax highlighting, hover information, and consistent auto-sorting for Tailwind CSS classes, so you can learn Tailwind while you use it.

### Path Intellisense

Autocompletes file paths as you type them in import statements, eliminating "module not found" errors from typos.

## Customization & Visualization

_Personalizing your workspace and making your code easier to read at a glance_

- **[Peacock](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.vscode-peacock)** - Color-code your projects
- **[Indent Rainbow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow)** - Visualize your code structure
- **[Folder Path Color](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexanderte.folder-path-color)** - Better file tree visualization
- **[Custom CSS and JS Loader](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css)** - Personalize everything

### Indent Rainbow

Colors your indentation levels, making it easier to visualize hierarchies, nested objects, and looping. Also highlights when lines are not correctly indented / have unnecessary spaces. IMO this one has an outsized impact for how simple it is.

<Image

  height={800}
  className="rounded-lg my-8"
/>

### Peacock

Changes your VSCode window color per project - that's it! Picking new colors for each new project is fun. This looks great with the Monokai theme imo.

<Image
  src="/blog/peacock.jpg"
  alt="Screenshot showing Peacock extension in action"
  width={1200}
  height={800}
  className="rounded-lg my-8"
/>

**Setup:** Once installed, press `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`, search "Peacock", and (e.g.) run the "Change to a favorite color" command.

### Folder Path Color

Assign colors to individual folders/paths. Here was my styling for the chatbot project:

<Image
  src="/blog/folder-color.jpg"
  alt="Screenshot showing Folder Color extension in action"
  width={400}
  height={200}
  className="rounded-lg my-8"
/>

The colors also apply to the file names and tabs on your VS Code windows, which is a game changer. This is a great concept but imo a not great execution - this extension requires manual setup for each project and also has some shortcomings (e.g. the higher level folder will always overwrite the lower levels, so making /app/server will be overwrited by whatever you set /app to). Somebody should make a better one! (looking at you Andrew)

**Setup:** Configure your `settings.json` file like:

```json
"folderPathColor.folders": [
  {"path": "src/components", "color": "#4FC3F7"},
  {"path": "server", "color": "#81C784"}
]
```

### Custom CSS and JS Loader

Injects custom CSS and JavaScript into VSCode for visual tweaks. I've barely scratched the surface of this one, but there is a lot of potential.

**Setup:** Requires creating CSS files in your project and configuring the extension to load them. Check the extension documentation for instructions.

## Project Management

_Tracking progress, automatic reminders, and source control_

- **[Bookmarks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks)** - Never lose your place
- **[Todo Tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree)** - Actually functional comments
- **[Git History](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.githistory)** - Track your project's evolution

### Bookmarks

Bookmark specific lines in your code and jump between them instantly instead of scrolling through hundreds of lines trying to find "that one function."

**Setup:** Use `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` and search for "Bookmarks: Toggle" to mark lines, then "Bookmarks: List" to see all your bookmarks.

### Todo Tree

Scans your code for TODO, FIXME, and other comment tags and displays them in a tree view so you never forget about unfinished business.

<Image

  alt="Screenshot showing Todo Tree extension in action"

  height={300}
  className="rounded-lg my-8"
/>

I haven't tried this yet, but I imagine these tags would make your intentions very clear to the AI when you ask it to edit your code.

### Git History

Provides a visual representation of your Git commit history, so you can see exactly what changed when and debug newly-introduced issues.

## Efficiency & Navigation (WIP)

Everything here makes me feel like a legit coder / hacker, and also saves me a bunch of time and effort over the 1,000s of micro-actions every day.

### Navigation & Positioning

General recs:

- Window/tab navigation and positioning
- Moving/editing lines of code
- CLI navigation
- Go through all Mac settings
- Coding-specific typing practice (SpeedCoder, Typing.io)
- Clipboard manager
- You can [set up folders in your dock using aliases](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-apps-from-the-dock-mh35859/15.0/mac/15.0#mchlpf80766d), which helps me compartmentalize, example here:

<Image
  src="/blog/dock-folders.jpg"
  alt="Screenshot showing organized dock folders"
  width={600}
  height={300}
  className="rounded-lg my-8"
/>

- Get a window positioning app - [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) is free, [Magnet](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12) is $4.99, and [BetterSnapTool](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12) is $1.99. I use BetterSnapTool only because it's the one I'm used to - from my understanding they are all very similar. I have keyboard shortcuts configured for common layouts like left/right half, left/middle/right third, full screen, etc.

<Image
  src="/blog/bettersnaptool.jpg"
  alt="Screenshot showing BetterSnapTool window management"
  width={300}
  height={150}
  className="rounded-lg my-8"
/>

### Keyboard Shortcuts

My most used:
(Note: these are for Mac - Windows uses Control/Alt/Windows instead of Control/Option/Command, with some differences)

- Fn + Backspace = Delete (like the Windows key)
- Option⌥ + Backspace = Move cursor one word left/right
- Option⌥ + L/R Arrow = Move cursor one word left/right
- Option⌥ + Up/Dn Arrow = Move current line up/down
- Option⌥ + Shift + Arrow = Copy current line up/down
- Command⌘ + Shift + K = Delete Line
- Command⌘ + D = Duplicate cursor to next occurrence
- Command⌘ + Shift + \ = Jump to matching bracket
- Command⌘ + K + P = Copy path of active file
- Command⌘ + Opt + I (or Fn F12) = Inspect / Dev Console
- Command⌘ + Shift + . = Toggle hidden files in Finder
- Command⌘ + , = Open VS Code settings
- Command⌘ + Shift + P = VS Code command window
- ⌘ + Tab = Switch applications
- Ctrl + Tab = Switch tabs
- (Custom) Window Positioning shortcuts, like with Magnet or BetterSnap Tool: left/right half = Command⌘ 9/0; left/middle/right third = Command⌘ 1/2/3; left two thirds/right two thirds = Command⌘ 4/5

## Helpful Tools (that I don't fully understand yet)

_Extensions that have a lot of potential but I either haven't used yet or I'm not qualified enough to explain_

- **[REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client)** - Test APIs without leaving VSCode
- **[Postman](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Postman.postman-for-vscode)** - API development and testing
- **[ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets)** - Speed up React development
- **[Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)** - Consistent dev environments

### REST Client

Lets you send HTTP requests directly from VSCode, which seems helpful for testing APIs without switching tools.

### Postman

A comprehensive tool for API development and testing that everyone talks about for backend work.

### ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets

Provides shortcuts for common React code patterns and component boilerplate.

### Dev Containers

Lets you develop inside a containerized environment, which can solves the "it works on my machine" problem.

## Settings Tweaks

_Small changes that make a big difference_

### Theme

I personally love **Monokai** or other high-contrast themes with clear color-coding. Good syntax highlighting makes it easier to scan your code quickly and spot different types of elements (strings, functions, variables, etc.).

### File Tree Indentation

I find it helpful to increase the file tree indentation from the default 8px to ~20px for better visual hierarchy:

```json
"workbench.tree.indent": 20
```

### Render Indent Guides

Always show indent guides to help with code structure visualization:

```json
"editor.renderIndentGuides": true,
"editor.guides.indentation": true
```

### Other Helpful Settings

```json
{
  "editor.fontSize": 14,
  "editor.lineHeight": 1.5,
  "editor.minimap.enabled": false,
  "editor.wordWrap": "on",
  "files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
  "terminal.integrated.fontSize": 13
}
```

A good setup is the one that makes you feel confident and productive, not necessarily what's the most popular. Don't feel pressured to download everything at once — having a bunch of new tools with no knowledge of how to use them will probably end up being a net-negative on your experience. Add them gradually as you identify specific pain points in your workflow and get a grasp on each extension's benefits.
