My first trip to New York City (in 2022) was with my then-fiancee Sophia and her friend Rose. Despite living in the city with the second-largest theatre district (Cleveland's Playhouse Square), it was this trip that truly unlocked the magic of theatre for me.

I didn't even _anticipate_ liking Broadway shows very much - in fact, I primarily was in town to play in a squash tournament and watch the Tournament of Champions at Grand Central Terminal. So while the two of them went to see as many Broadway shows as possible over the weekend, I spent most of my time playing and watching squash. Eventually I begrudgingly went with them to see s play called _POTUS_ - and I was hooked from there. We have Rose to thank for the introduction. Since then, my wife and I have indulged in many "show-maxxing weekends" in the big city, and we began paying attention to the theatre scene in Cleveland, which happens to be quite good as well.

I've only skimmed the Internet for evidence that we were not the ones to invent show-maxxing -- while I'm sure the idea has existed for decades, I at least did not come up with any results for the exact term "show-maxxing". I found [tips for seeing two shows in one day](https://www.tdf.org/on-stage/tdf-stages/tips-for-seeing-two-shows-in-one-day-on-broadway-and-beyond/) (which also includes a link to a YouTube video of a couple who managed a 5-show day, which is something I just now determined must be done in my lifetime and that feels akin to the "perfect week" in college), ["broadway binge" reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/Broadway/comments/1dxuctd/broadway_binge_trip_reviews/), and [tips for seeing the most theatre in one day in NYC](https://www.newyorktheatreguide.com/theatre-news/news/how-to-see-the-most-theatre-in-one-day-in-new-york-city?utm_source=chatgpt.com) - but no _show-maxxing_.

## What exactly is it?

We call it **show-maxxing**—the ultimate Broadway binge. It's not just seeing shows; it's an art form, a lifestyle, a carefully orchestrated dance between TKTS booths, matinees, and red-eye flights.

**Show-Maxxing** (verb): The art of cramming as many Broadway shows as humanly possible into a single NYC weekend. Typically involves meticulous planning, bouncing between TKTS and your hotel, strategic meals, and an aggressive schedule of Friday night through Sunday matinee performances—followed by a red-eye home and zero regrets.

_Example: "We're show-maxxing this weekend: I'm going to see Wicked, The Lion King, Hadestown, Cabaret, and Death Becomes Her - all in the next 48 hours!"_

## The Perfect Show-Maxxing Weekend

### Friday: The Arrival

- ✈ **Fly in early** (take Friday off work)
- 🏨 **Uber to hotel**, drop bags in storage
- 🎟 **Get to TKTS by 2:30 PM** (opens at 3 PM), buy Friday night & Saturday matinee tickets
- 🛍 **Back to hotel**, retrieve bags, check in, unpack, shower, and get dressed
- 🍽 **Quick dinner**
- 🎭 **Friday Evening Show**
- 😴 **Sleep**

### Saturday: The Marathon

- ☀ **Wake up**, hotel breakfast
- 🎟 **Back to TKTS** (11 AM opening) for Saturday evening tickets (and any missed matinee)
- 🍽 **Grab lunch**
- 🎭 **Saturday Matinee**
- 🎟 **Return to TKTS** for Sunday matinee tickets
- 🏨 **Hotel pit stop** (freshen up, outfit change)
- 🍽 **Dinner**
- 🎭 **Saturday Evening Show**
- 😴 **Sleep**

### Sunday: The Grand Finale

- ☀ **Wake up**, hotel breakfast
- 🎟 **(if needed) back to TKTS** for last-minute Sunday matinee
- 🎭 **Sunday Matinee**
- 🧳 **Back to hotel**, grab bags
- ✈ **Head to airport**
- 🍽 **Dinner at the terminal**
- 🛬 **Fly home**

### Monday: The Recovery

- ☕ **Straight back to work** (running on Broadway magic and caffeine)

## Modifications

Whether you're a theatrical maximalist or a travel minimalist, there are plenty of ways to tailor the show-maxxing experience to your lifestyle, budget, and PTO balance:

- **Fly In Early Friday**: Take an early-morning flight and land in time to hit TKTS and catch a 1 or 2 PM Friday matinee.

- **Fly in Thursday Night After Work**: Arrive late Thursday and start fresh Friday morning. This gives you a full day in the city and avoids early Friday travel stress.

- **The Red-Eye Riser**: Cap off the weekend with a Sunday evening show and fly out on a red-eye. You'll be exhausted Monday, but spiritually fulfilled.

- **Remote Work Friday**: If your job allows remote work, consider working a half or full day from your hotel on Friday. Head to a 3PM matinee after logging off or skip the matinee to save that precious PTO.

## The Show-Maxxing Philosophy

Some people go to NYC for the sights. We go for the TKTS line and to get our butts in as many different theatres as possible.

Show-maxxing isn't about relaxation—it's about **maximization**. Every minute counts. You're not there to see the Statue of Liberty or Times Square; you're there to see as much live theatre as humanly possible in 48 hours.

## The Logistics

### TKTS Strategy

- **Pro tip**: Have 2-3 backup shows in mind for each time slot
- **Friday**: Arrive by 2:30 PM for 3 PM opening for best options
- **Saturday**: Back at Arrive by 1-:30 AM for 11 AM opening for best options
- **Sunday**: One more trip if needed

### Hotels & Meal Planning

- Stay within walking distance of Times Square. You'll be making multiple trips back to your room for outfit changes and freshening up.
- Use travel cards and benefits. We've used the Amex Gold card to get free room upgrades and a daily dining credit that covers our hotel breakfast.
- Most restaurants around the theatre district already know that you're headed to a show and will have generally very fast service, sometimes prioritizing you if you mention you have a 6/7 PM show to catch.

## The Aftermath

You'll be exhausted. You'll be exhilarated. You'll have seen more theatre in one weekend than most people see in a decade. And you'll be planning your next show-maxxing trip before you even land back home.

That's the show-maxxing life.
