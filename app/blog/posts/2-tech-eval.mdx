## The call to games, to play, to allegory


### Pokemon: my window to the past and gateway to the future

Some of my greatest "Aha!" moments in programming are connected, somehow or other, to Pokemon. I can study Full Stack Open all day and apply concepts to web apps, and I can memorize syntax and read documentation all I want, but it's unfailingly when connecting a concept to its Pokemon-equivalent that all of the pieces finally *snap* into place in my brain and I suddenly understand how everything fits together, and I'm suddenly full of ideas and confidence and excitement. 

Over the last month, I have been studying to pass the technical checkpoint of Fractal's bootcamp, which essentially involves setting up a backend Express server to handle CRUD operations within a json database, and building a frontend React app that renders the entries of this database and allows the user to submit new entries through a form. The most common example is to have the database store a list of notes (with id and content properties) and have the form be a single text input with a Submit button, but for some extra practice and as a challenge to my understanding, I decided to build a similar application except with Pokemon entries instead of notes. I started out with just name, type, and id properties, which added just enough complexity to make it a challenge - requiring the use of template strings to combine all 3 properties into a kind of "Pokedex entry" rather than simply rendering the note content to a list element, additional state variables, an ordered list instead of unordered, and of course, trying to go from start to finish with minimal Googling or referencing other code. 

Anyways, I did it! As usual, I initially felt extremely proud, excited, and even accomplished - but this feeling was soon after hijacked by the imposter syndrome, which told me that my version of a Pokedex was NOTHING compared to what's on Bulbapedia or Serebii, and that an application like this doesn't actually provide value to anyone other than yourself. I ignored that voice, at least for a little bit. I'll come back to that. First, let's talk about dreams.


### Explicitly labelling dreams

I'm pretty sure I know what I want to do.
Moment in car in Royal Oak, intense feeling of "this is what I am called to do, need to do, want more than anything to do"
But I'm also cognizant of a phenomenon that often happens after making something concrete like this.
The first time that Parth and I went to dinner - which would be the catalyst for him becoming a lifelong friend, roommate, groomsman in my wedding, roommate in NYC, and companion in birding, transformative video games, coding, and much more (who knows, maybe godfather is next) - we talked about what drove us, kept us up at night, how we want to change the world, some loose ideas about how we might do that, but overarchingly keeping the conversation extremely abstract - i.e. instead of "let's start a podcast, how do we do that", we were interested in what it was about podcasts that allowed people to be transformed, why the release and discussion of ideas can be such a profound experience for yourself and for others, and what are the aspects of media that truly provide value to humans. But I distinctly remember that at one point, I suggested a concrete solution - I don't remember exactly what, but something along the lines of "I really want to start a YouTube channel" - and Parth was very quick to stop me, interrupting with "no no no, don't put a label on it yet, that will only limit us needlessly". And I remember realizing in that moment that he was right - by putting such a concrete label on the thing that I wanted to do, I saw that it had been holding me back, that this didn't feed the soul like our discussions did. 

So all of that is to say, ever since that first dinner, I've been extremely cautious about assigning labels, concrete solutions to dreams, ambitions, feelings. And also Parth is cool.


### Passing the technical checkpoint

Staying up until 1am with Parth building a chatroom application. I'll be honest, I thought it was really stupid when we first started. I had a list of 10 subtasks that I needed to be able to showcase in 12 hours, and I figured our call would just be a simple and straightforward example that would check all of the boxes and ensure that I was ready for the evaluation the next day. In my mind, we were not off to a good start - first, because I thought his suggestion to build a chatroom application wasn't super relevant to what I needed to be able to build, and second, because the first thing out of his mouth was "before we actually write any code, I like to write things out on paper first". It's only now, after passing the evaluation with flying colors, that I realized he was correct on both accounts. 

Writing/thinking things out before starting to build each piece was extremely helpful, and I believe an important step to being a competent software engineer. However, I was feeling impatient, so I decided to start building the skeleton of the app while we talked (sorry Parth). I had a "get it done" attitude and, now that I think about it, maybe even a subconscious desire for superiority (e.g. "I don't need to do your silly exercises, I'm just going to start the actual work while he dicks around with his notebook"), but karma would have it that I would learn my lesson once we started working together and I was sharing my screen. I had violated part of the software engineer's oath, to build things one step at a time and verify that your application works at each stage - whereas what I was doing was starting every single component that I could think of and writing down the pieces of each that immediately came to mind (e.g. "need a useEffect here, use axios", "need an event handler for changing the input", defining state variables, writing out the HTML skeleton, etc.). 


### Memorization vs. Competence & Understanding   /  Re-emergence

This actually gets at another idea that I've been noodling on, which relates to the conversation about competence. To explain it, I need to take you back to grade school for just a few sentences. I've always been a STEM kid through and through - advanced placement math, engineering courses in high school - but I always struggled to do well in subjects like History, English, Theology, etc. I distinctly remember feeling frustrated after not doing well on a 4th grade History exam and thinking something along the lines of "I'll never be good at this stuff - I can memorize the material all I want, but as soon as the teacher rewords or rearranges the phrasing of the questions, I don't understand it anymore. It's like I can't access the information that I studied if the question on the test isn't in EXACTLY the same format/phrasing/etc." This was my running theory for quite some time - the idea that my brain "only understands numbers, patterns, and logic, but not words or events that I can't even see" - and it wouldn't be until 10+ years later that this theory would finally be superseded. 

While I don't remember exactly when (definitely within the last 2 years), I remember thinking: "maybe it's NOT the case that your brain simply CAN'T demonstrate your true understanding despite your understanding of the material - maybe the reality of the situation is that you just didn't actually UNDERSTAND the material, but rather KNEW the material from having read through it a couple times, and therefore the extent of my ability to demonstrate my knowledge of the material was limited to the single, exact context that I learned the material in, i.e. "question worded a specific way: answer", and therefore, when presented with even a SLIGHTLY different context on the exam, i.e. "question worded/formatted/phrased/presented slightly differently: same answer but requiring a deeper understanding", my thought process simply broke down and did not function as I expected it to. 

A similar phenomenon reared its head during my initial attempt(s) at the technical checkpoint earlier this month. I had learned how to create a backend server and frontend React app, following along with Full Stack Open, Scrimba, etc., and mistook this having "built this thing" for "actually understanding how this thing works, especially in different contexts/variations, and being able to effectively build it, troubleshoot it, and explore alternatives". As you may suspect, the same breakdown in thinking process / functioning that had occured during my 4th grade history exam occured in the middle of my coding evaluation over 10 years later. However, armed with my new superior theory of competence - and the conviction that I AM good at coding, or at least have the potential to be, unlike what I believed to be true about 4th grade history - I understood that, even if I did conceptually understand all/most of the material, I simply wasn't at the desired level of competence yet, and I needed to practice more. 

(ADHD Aside - feel free to skip) This mismatch between perceived competence and functional competence is likely an all-too-familiar occurence for people with ADHD or similar conditions. In these cases, it is much more often that the issue lies in the execution, the doing of the thing, than it does with the lack of knowledge about doing said thing. Namely, it is the brain's EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS that are impaired by something like ADHD - some of these impaired functions being mental flexibility, task initiation, organization, working memory, and goal-oriented planning. It's my belief that one of the major factors in the prolonged existence of my "incorrect theory of competence", and likely other dysfunctional/maladapted beliefs and behaviors, is the perceived surface-level sameness between:
    - a neurotypical individual who has little knowledge/competence/wisdom but is at least able to effectively demonstrate the level that they possess, and
    - a neurospicy individual who has a lot of knowledge/competence/wisdom but is unable to effectively demonstrate this level due to impaired executive functions
If you genuinely think this is a load of crap, or is unnecessarily verbose, or you actually want to hear more, please let me know! I'm super passionate about this stuff (particularly ADHD) and will inevitably be including this type of content regardless of the discussion topic. 


### Chatroom, continued

As it relates to how I started this post, the entire previous section was essentially just to make the point that those silly little exercises and projects that Parth had me doing until 1 o'clock in the morning actually paid off.
Or, even more succinctly: Parth was right, Ben was wrong. 
I of all people should've known better, too. It is fundamental to the engineering process to begin by laying out your assumptions, a problem definition, and what you know, don't know, and need to know - all before working on any kind of solution. After all, this is part of what makes engineering so difficult, and I believe what sets apart good engineers and great engineers. A lot of good engineers know how to code, how to set up a backend server, and how to get a frontend app working with it, but I believe it takes a great engineer to solve a problem that hasn't ever been solved before, to create a real solution to a real problem - without following a tutorial. If the engineering process is ignored and you start *eh-hem* coding the frontend while your friend does the right thing and breaks out the structure on paper first *eh-hem*, you might be almost done with a fully implemented solution only to realize that you were solving the wrong problem or had the wrong approach and need to start from scratch. If you don't believe me, take it from Einstein: "If I had an hour to solve a problem, I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions"; or from Charles Kettering: "A problem well-defined is a problem already half-solved". 

Aside from the obvious benefits of NOT blatantly IGNORING tried-and-true problem-solving methods, aka the engineering process, and thinking about what you're going to make BEFORE you make it, I also gain from this experience a new insight on my journey towards understanding what it takes to be a competent engineer. Parth is a better engineer than I give him credit for. He often ends up defying my expectations - which, initially, can be a source of confusion or frustation, but more often than not ends up revealing deep insights that I didn't even know I didn't know. I hope he takes that as a compliment lol. 


### the next day

See, I told you I would come back to it. After passing the technical, I wanted to get some more practice in before the bootcamp starts, and after briefly starting on a task tracker app, I decided it might be more fun to expand on my little Pokedex app. 

After cleaning it up and adding PUT and DELETE routes, I realized that my brain was generating new ideas way faster than my fingers could code, so I created ideas.txt and began throwing every new functionality I could think of onto the screen. Adding the base stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Speed, etc.) to each entry would be relatively straightforward, and the same with abilities, held items, descriptions, and maybe even sprites. The features that made me stop and take a step back were evolution and learnset. Should I create a nested object called 'evolution' within the 'pokemon' object, and give it properties like 'evolveFrom: false' and 'evolveTo: true'? Should evolveFromMethod and evolveToMethod both live in the evolution object? Should I separate evolveTo and evolveFrom into two separate objects? How can I actually account for the various evolution methods, and what would optimizing it look like? Similarly, with 'learnset', I started out with an object that contained a list of [move, levelLearned] arrays for each move that the Pokemon learns, but quickly had thoughts such as: I don't want to repeat the data associated with each move every time a single Pokemon can learn it, so how do I "call" the data of a move any time it's present in a Pokemon's learnset entry? Do I make separate objects for learnByTM and learnByLevelUp, or would a boolean 'learnByTM' be better, or would it be better to have a single property called 'learnBy' where the value is either "TM" or an integer for level? 

It wasn't until this point...

```json {
    pokemon: {
        id: 1
        name: "Bulbasaur",
        type: "grass",
        evolution: {
            evolveFrom: {
                tf: false,
                method: null  
            }
            evolveTo: {
                tf: true,
                method: [level: 16]
            }
        },
        learnset: {
            byLevelUp: [
                [move: "vine whip", level: 7],
                [move: "razor leaf", level: 20],
                [...]
            ]
            byTM: ["hyper beam", "frenzy plant", "surf", ...],
        },
        abilities: {
            base: ["Quark Drive", "Guts"],
            hidden: ["Sap Sipper"]
        },
        heldItems: ["some berry"],
        category: "Seed Pokemon",
        description: "Bulbasaur is a small, quadrupedal amphibian Pokémon that has blue-green skin with darker patches.",
        obtainMethods: [trade, "Viridian Forest", "Cerulean City"],
        sprites: [bulbasaurMain.jpg, bulbasaurBack.jpg],
        breeding: {},
        cries: {},
        experience: 101,
        height: 10,
        weight: 10
    }
}

...that I finally remembered a little something called "PokeAPI" that was already in my bookmarks. One click of the mouse and *boom* - all of those questions were answered and everything that my brain had just been furiously trying to process/sort/imagine/create appeared on the screen in front of me. It was one of those moments that is simultaneously validating, groundbreaking, and dispiriting - validating, because it means that my "original idea" of this thing to build WAS actually on the right track and IS something valuable to people; groundbreaking, because your concept of where the limit of possibility is is suddenly expanded to a new proportion; and crushing, because seeing the paragon for whatever project you just sunk a boatload of struggle-filled hours into has a way of making all of that effort feel a little bit...shall we say...unnecessary. 

However, I think it's a good kind of crushing - as in, maybe the feeling that all the work you just did was *unnecessary* is a *necessary* kind of crushing. 
Reminds me of a quote by Susan Sontag, that "depression is melancholy minus its charms". Feeling that your life and all of your work is meaningless, that's depression, there's no charm to it. But visiting PokeAPI after unknowingly spending a bunch of time trying to reinvent it - that's melancholy. It inspires a deeper understanding of oneself and the world, it can be a source of inner strength. Depression, on the other hand, saps you of all of your strength and replaces it with despair. 

Anyways, going down this little aside gave me a few minutes to reflect on where I'm actually at right now, mentally, after spending a couple hours writing this, post-re-discovering-PokeAPI's-existence-and-giving-up-on-everything-I-was-working-on. Coding is still cool, I still want to become a really good engineer, and life can still be meaningful even when you're being crushed. 


Until next time,
Ben B.
