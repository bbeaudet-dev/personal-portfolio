Blockers:

Wins:

PRs:

Code Review:


### EOD 5 - Friday 6/6

Blockers: Deployment was a bit unintuitive - I was just happy to get it working. The last few days have been backwards for me - I deployed my shitty app and now need to go back and do web sockets and add APIs. 

Wins: Very few blockers again, yesterday and today have felt like a rocketship learning pace and I’m having a seriously good time. Routing was easier than I expected and unlocked a lot of other insights. By the time I started making my lobby (around lunch), I was in a great flow state and felt like I understood how every file/part of my app was communicating/working with each other. Took a break after deployment to add some cool styles to my lobby and feel a lot more confident with CSS now too.

### EOD 4 - Thursday 6/5

Blockers: Other than having a lot of catching up and learning to do, I'm happy to say there were very few blockers today. Couldn't have asked for better support from the instructors as I navigated some mental/emotional challenges. Need to put some time towards lobbying, routing, live updates, on top of nailing down server/database/api communication. 

Wins: Started today from the example tic-tac-toe code from Day 1 and finished the day with a working client-server game and the bones of a client-database game (that at least adds a new game to the Supabase db). Learned a ton about error handling, fetching, useEffect, promises, databases, and interfaces. I have a renewed vigor and am excited to be here.

### EOD 3 - Wednesday 6/4

Blockers: Felt super burnt out today, couldn’t focus at all, didn’t understand new concepts introduced. Feeling behind already and finding it very difficult to catch up, especially on top of readings/reviews/etc. Being an “out of sight out of mind” person, I’m finding it tough to keep track of everything between the monorepo, Discord channels, and online resources/documentations. A lot of concepts in today’s lectures were new to me and it felt like I was expected to already have mastered them - I get that we aren’t going to “waste time being taught every concept”, but this led to confusing expectations for me and likely contributed to feeling burnt out. I don’t mind the feeling of flying by the seat of my pants, but when my whole day is banging my head against the wall and Googling/AI, it feels like I’m not making any progress / getting left behind. 

Wins: got a decent conceptual understanding of interfaces and implementations, and expanded on my knowledge of databases and servers. 

PRs: 
https://github.com/bbeaudet-dev/tictactoe-multi/pull/1,

Code Review: Looked over a bunch of PRs but not feeling confident/qualified to assess other people’s code. Should I be trying/making comments anyways, even if they are wrong?


### EOD 2 - Tuesday 6/3

Blockers: Need to deepen my understanding of general CSS layouts and React (specifically props). Made it through the Messages Thread and partly through the Post. I also need to make a point of not letting other areas slip - like code reviews, readings, trainings, etc. - due to hyperfocusing on the exercises all day.

Wins: Lots of ‘Aha!’ moments today, many of which came from things I struggled with yesterday. Overall, this gave me a much more positive attitude today, even though I wasn’t able to finish all the examples. Tailwind came surprisingly naturally and I’m super happy we had a day dedicated to styling, which in a way felt like a “break” from being crushed by tic-tac-toe yesterday. The power of clsx finally became clear around 8pm and I think a lot of things are starting to click.

Code Review: didn’t get to this yet - will do tonight/tomorrow before 9am.


### EOD 1 - Monday 6/2

Blockers - I think I’m struggling with some fundamental concepts and syntax. I haven’t done any TypeScript, which felt like it compounded any problem I ran into. I followed along super well when Andrew built tic-tac-toe, but it felt like I instantly forgot everything I’ve learned when I sat down to make it. Simple things seem to throw me off very easily, such as moving the game logic to a separate file, certain aspects of functions, or the distinction between game logic and client side. I think I took “no AI” to mean that Googling was also discouraged, and I learn better when I struggle with something on my own anyways, but maybe I’m just in a position where I need to be asking for more help or studying more fundamentals. 

Wins - Picked up TypeScript pretty quickly and understand its benefits. Finished most of tic-tac-toe with minimal help/googling, stuck with it even when frustrated. Loved hearing about the culture/expectations and setting the tone for the bootcamp. Didn’t get lost as Andrew blazed through our entire day’s work.
