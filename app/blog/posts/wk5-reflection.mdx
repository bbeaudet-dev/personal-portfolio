_Week 5 of Fractal Tech's AI Accelerator & Engineering Bootcamp_

## WIP

I had another moment of "expanding the realm of possibilities with computers and coding". This week centered around React Native, i.e. utilizing a device's (iPhone, e.g.) _native_ capabilities (gyroscope, camera, etc.).

The first "module" that piqued my interest was the accelerometer, and I quickly got a working "app" that displayed live accelerometer data. From there, I created a live plot of the data over time, and I also added a "max acceleration" that would track the user's highest achieved acceleration. (screenshot of acceleratomere finished screenshot) From this was born an idea for this week's project: a sort of puzzle game where the user solves puzzles corresponding to the different modules on their phone in a gamified way. In fact, the first puzzle that I thought of was this: what if, to achieve a certain acceleration value, I would need to literally chuck my phone as hard as I could into a couch cushion? Well, it worked surpisingly well! Somewhere around 75-100 m/s^2, it becomes extremely difficult to achieve without literally chucking your phone as hard as humanly possible, and a couch just so happens to be the perfect place to do this. It was a very proud moment when, during the live demo, I did exactly this and achieved an acceleration of 103 m/s^2! From that was hatched the idea that the user's phone has somehow become _corrupted_, and the point of the game is to "cleanse" each native feature from infection by solving its corresponding puzzle. (video of corupted app names) Then I thought it would be cool if this game _presented_ as something entirely different, like say a tower defense game where you defend your CPU from bugs, and one of the first screens could be a very obvious "DOWNLOAD" button, which would trigger some kind of infection sequence, kicking off the real game. (screenshot of menu with download button) And thus, the idea of CORE DEFENDER was born... I intended it to have more horror elements, almost like the game Anatomy (add link to markiplier's anatomy video on youtube), where the "core" of your phone is actually a living entity and restoring it would act as the final boss, but I didn't get too far into this.

Anyways, I'm actually pretty happy with how it turned out in the end.

Friend showed me a similar game afterwards - blackbox?

Struggles:

- UI / creativity rabbit hole, no defined goal
- Managing large modular file structure
- Integration, harder than I thought, way more interactions in a “simple” game than I expected, gets complex fast
- Feeling of throwing in the towel and wanting to scrap the whole project
