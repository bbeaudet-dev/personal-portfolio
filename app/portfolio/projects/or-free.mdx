_Designing a self-contained kit for on-the-go demonstrations of the first wireless MIS surgical device_

## Overview

Designed and manufactured a portable demonstration kit for Lazurite's ArthroFree wireless surgical device. Lazurite is pioneering the first-ever wireless surgical device for minimally invasive surgery (arthroscopy), and since this product typically requires a full operating room to demonstrate, my task was to create a self-contained, portable kit that could showcase the technology to potential customers anywhere.

## Key Contributions

- **Portable Design**: Created a self-contained, self-powered demonstration kit with 6+ hours of battery life
- **Custom Enclosure**: Designed and manufactured 15+ custom 3D-printed and laser-cut parts for an aesthetically pleasing acrylic shell
- **Power Management**: Integrated OmniCharge 20+ power system with battery charging capabilities while case is closed
- **Storage Solution**: Collaborated with packaging manufacturer to design custom foam insert for organized component storage
- **Manufacturing Documentation**: Created comprehensive 100+ step manufacturing guide for production

## Technical Specifications

The demonstration kit included:

- GAEMS Sentinel portable gaming monitor (1080p) as the base case and display
- OmniCharge 20+ power system for extended battery life
- Wireless device and receiver storage
- 1-2 arthroscopes and couplers
- 2+ device batteries with charging capability
- 10+ custom cables and electronic components from Digikey
- AirTag integration for device tracking
- Magnetic attachment system for easy access to internal components

## Design Features

- **Modular Construction**: Easily detachable acrylic shell using magnetic connections for troubleshooting access
- **Professional Aesthetics**: Clean, medical-grade appearance suitable for customer presentations
- **Durability**: Robust construction to withstand travel and repeated demonstrations
- **User-Friendly**: Simple connection and setup process for sales team use

## Impact

Successfully manufactured 10 demonstration kits that were distributed across the country to Lazurite's sales team and distributors. These kits enabled the company to showcase their revolutionary wireless surgical technology to potential customers without requiring access to operating room facilities, significantly expanding their ability to demonstrate the product's capabilities.

## Reflection

This project demonstrated the importance of understanding both technical requirements and user needs in product design. Creating a demonstration kit that was both technically functional and aesthetically appropriate for medical device presentations required balancing engineering constraints with design considerations. The experience of taking a product from concept to manufacturing, including creating detailed documentation for production, provided valuable insights into the full product development lifecycle.
