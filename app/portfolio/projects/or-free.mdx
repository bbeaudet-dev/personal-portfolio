_Designing a self-contained kit for on-the-go demonstrations of the first wireless MIS surgical device_

## Overview

Designed and manufactured a portable demonstration kit for Lazurite's ArthroFree wireless surgical device. Lazurite is pioneering the first-ever wireless surgical device for minimally invasive surgery (arthroscopy), and since this product typically requires a full operating room to demonstrate, my task was to create a self-contained, portable kit that could showcase the technology to potential customers anywhere.

## Key Contributions

- **Portable Design**: Created a self-contained, self-powered demonstration kit with 6+ hours of battery life
- **Custom Enclosure**: Designed and manufactured 10 units with custom 3D-printed and laser-cut parts
- **Power Management**: Integrated OmniCharge 20+ with battery charging capabilities while case is closed
- **Storage Solution**: Collaborated with packaging manufacturer to design custom foam insert for organized component storage
- **Manufacturing Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation with 100+ step assembly guide

## Technical Specifications

The demonstration kit included:

- GAEMS Sentinel portable gaming monitor (1080p) as the base case and display
- OmniCharge 20+ power system for long battery life
- Storage for wireless surgical device, corresponding receiver, 1-2 arthroscopes and couplers, and 2+ device batteries 
- 10+ custom cables and electronic components from Digikey
- AirTag integration for device tracking
- Magnetically-attached panel system for easy access to internal components
- Laser-cut company branding for visually-appealing presentation

## Impact

Successfully manufactured 10 demonstration kits that were distributed across the country to Lazurite's sales team and distributors. These kits enable the company to showcase their revolutionary wireless surgical technology to potential customers anywhere and anytime, bypassing the need to be in an operating room or otherwise have access to expensive surigcal tower equipment.
