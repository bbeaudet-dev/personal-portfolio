After [building a CLI-only version of a dice-rolling roguelike](/portfolio/rollio), my next challenge was to create a web-based version without breaking the CLI version or rewriting core game logic.

After severely over-engineering my game engine's type safety, I started this iteration by flattening my file structure, refactoring game logic, and building a working roguelike progression system.

Once the core CLI game was playable, enjoyable, and even somewhat "finished", I took another swing at implementing a web version - and was shocked to see how quickly and cleanly I got it working. Better GameState management definitely helped, and I had also come a lot closer to having a game engine running exclusively on _pure functions_. 


## Technologies Used

- TypeScript (core logic and type safety)
- React (frontend)
- Node.js & Express (API + server)
