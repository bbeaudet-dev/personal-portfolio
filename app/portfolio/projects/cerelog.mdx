_Designing firmware to measure and transmit brainwave data between EEG devices and computers through serial communication_

## Overview

Cerelog is revolutionizing human-computer interaction through advanced neural interface technology, developing high-resolution Brain Computer Interface (BCI) platforms. Their flagship product, the Cerelog ESP-EEG, is an 8-channel biosensing circuit board designed for EEG, EMG, ECG, and BCI research applications with 24-bit ADC resolution and 500 SPS sample rate.

During my internship at Cerelog, I worked on BrainFlow integration and dataflow optimization for their EEG hardware. This project involved developing systems for real-time brainwave data processing and serial communication, building robust protocols to handle the complex data flow between their ESP32-based hardware and software applications.

## Key Contributions

- **BrainFlow Integration**: Improved hardware integration with the BrainFlow library, an industry-standard open-source library for biosignal processing
- **Timestamp Optimization**: Developed time-function improvements to achieve accurate timestamping within 125ms precision
- **Serial Protocol Management**: Implemented message packaging and unpacking for the ADS1289 chip data format with proper padding and checksum validation
- **Error Handling**: Built robust error handling and data formatting systems for reliable data flow between hardware and software
- **Board Configuration**: Set up parametric configuration capabilities for sample rates, channel control, and voltage signal gain adjustments

## Technical Details

The project involved working with Cerelog's ESP32-based EEG hardware and the BrainFlow library. Key technical challenges included:

- **Serial Protocol Implementation**: Working with the ADS1289 chip's specific message format requiring 2-byte start markers, 1-byte message length, 4-byte timestamps, 27-byte data payloads, and checksum validation
- **Arduino ESP32 Integration**: Developing firmware for the ESP32 chip to handle SPI communication with the ADS1289 and USB serial communication with the computer
- **BrainFlow Compatibility**: Ensuring the hardware could seamlessly integrate with BrainFlow's push_package() format for downstream signal processing and ML applications
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Managing buffer systems and implementing timestamp synchronization for accurate 500Hz data collection

## Impact

This internship experience was foundational in my understanding of how software engineering can be applied to real-world problems in emerging technology fields. The work with brainwave data and serial communication systems demonstrated the importance of building robust, real-time systems that can handle complex data streams reliably.

## Reflection

This project marked an important step in my transition from mechanical engineering to software engineering. Working with brainwave data and real-time systems showed me how software can be used to interface with and process data from physical sensors and devices, bridging the gap between hardware and software in meaningful ways.
