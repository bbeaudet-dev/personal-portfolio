## Overview

During my time in the railroad trackwork industry, I developed CAD automation tools and project management systems to streamline design processes and improve efficiency. This project involved creating custom software solutions to automate repetitive design tasks and modernize legacy workflows.

## Key Contributions

- **CAD Automation**: Developed Visual Basic applications to automate repetitive CAD design tasks, significantly reducing manual work
- **Project Management Tools**: Built custom tools for managing trackwork design projects and coordinating with manufacturing teams
- **Process Optimization**: Identified inefficiencies in existing design workflows and implemented software solutions to address them
- **Technology Integration**: Advocated for and implemented modern design methods and technology adoption within the organization

## Technical Details

The automation work primarily involved Visual Basic programming to create custom tools that could interface with CAD software and automate repetitive design tasks. This included developing scripts for generating standard components, automating dimensioning and annotation processes, and creating tools for project tracking and management.

## Impact

These automation tools helped improve design efficiency and reduce manual errors in the trackwork design process. The work demonstrated the value of applying software engineering principles to traditional mechanical engineering workflows, showing how coding skills can enhance productivity in any technical field.

## Reflection

This project was instrumental in my discovery of software engineering as a career path. Working with Visual Basic to solve real engineering problems showed me how programming could be applied to automate and improve traditional engineering workflows. The experience of building tools that directly impacted manufacturing processes and helped carry trains full of New Yorkers was incredibly rewarding and helped shape my understanding of how software can create real-world impact.

The work also highlighted the importance of staying current with technology in traditional industries, as many established companies struggle to keep pace with modern design methods and automation tools.
