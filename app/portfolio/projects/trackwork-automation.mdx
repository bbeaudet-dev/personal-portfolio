_Building programs to parametrize and automate entire CAD processes for railroad trackwork_

## Overview

During my time in the railroad trackwork industry, I developed CAD automation tools and project management systems to streamline design processes and improve efficiency. This project involved creating custom software solutions to automate repetitive design tasks and modernize legacy workflows.

## Key Contributions

- **CAD Automation**: Developed Visual Basic applications to automate repetitive CAD design tasks, significantly reducing manual work
- **Project Management Tools**: Built custom tools for managing trackwork design projects and coordinating with manufacturing teams
- **Technology Integration**: Advocated for and implemented modern design methods and technology adoption within the organization

## Reflection

This project was instrumental in my career path as a software engineer. Teaching myself Visual Basic to solve real engineering problems showed me the limitless potential of coding and how it could be applied to both practical and creative projects.

The work also highlighted the importance of staying current with technology in traditional industries, as many established companies struggle to keep pace with modern design methods and automation tools. Additionally, I learned that being on the cutting edge of new technology, or otherwise working to modernize legacy systems, is a fulfilling and motivating space for me as an engineer.
