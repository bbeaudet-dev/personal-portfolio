## Background

Around the time that I [quit my job](/blog/taking-the-leap), I was making an effort to explore as many different software engineering niches as possible, in an effort to find which ones interested me the most, when I stumbled on [CS50's Pokemon coding tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx_qorHxBpI). If you've read literally anything I've ever written, you probably know that games have always been a part of my life and that game dev is super interesting to me, especially now that I've taken the leap into software.

At this point, I had played countless [Pokemon ROM hacks](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/ROM_hack) with friends, but it wasn't until I discovered this video and [Emerald decomps](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) that I seriously started to think of Pokemon as _something that is actually running on code_.

After quickly becoming overwhelmed with the size of the codebase and the then-unfamiliar repository conventions/terminology, I discovered an awesome YouTuber called [Team Aqua's Hideout](https://www.youtube.com/@TeamAquasHideout) and their [series on ROM hacking tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLNv9Lq6kDmTIYfN5NvgQRvfOHTOXl0uU) and promptly spent a couple weeks working through much of the playlist.

Now possessing a small amount of Pokemon ROM hacking expertise, my brain started exploding with all kinds of creative ideas for new games and features and maps, and I spent the next couple of weeks mapping out several full ROM hack concepts on digital walls of sticky notes (MURAL). I, of course, was getting _way ahead_ of myself and still completely unaware of just how much work game dev truly involves.

After becoming disillusioned with the fact that my walls of sticky notes would _not_ be magically transforming themselves into the vibrant games that I imagined in my head, I turned back to coding fundamentals in preparation of Fractal Tech's program coming up in a couple short months.
