_An enhanced AI Smart Mirror with more robust design and advanced customization_

## Overview

Building on the original AI Smart Mirror, this project is a redesign focused on robustness, customization, and multimodal AI capabilities. This will transform the smart mirror from a single-purpose event tool into a comprehensive daily personal assistant.

## Key Improvements

### Hardware Enhancements

- **Better foam window** for the monitor border to be less noticeable
- **Mirror material** updated from acrylic to real glass
- **Improved monitor mounting** to replace the first iteration's tape-heavy system
- **Standardize nylon standoffs** for cost reduction and overall measurement standardization
- **Power management system** to reduce always-on power consumption

### Software Enhancements

- **Enhanced UI/UX** with text displays and visual indicators for motion detection, loading states, and AI processes
- **Voice command integration** for hands-free interaction and customization
- **Morning/Evening routines** with personalized daily schedules
- **Multimodal data processing** combining weather, calendar, and outfit data for comprehensive recommendations
