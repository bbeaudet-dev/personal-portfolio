### Background

For anyone that hasn't played Balatro, it's basically poker on steroids. You can upgrade, clone, and remove cards from your deck, there is a shop where you can buy and sell items, and you have a set of _Jokers_ which come with all kinds of abilities.

There are 31 achievements in the game - 20 of which anyone can get casually, 7 of which require solid strategy and dedication, and the remaining 4 of which are designed to _suck the living soul out of your body_.

I currently sit at 30/31 achievements completed. I made this tool to visualize and track my progress on the final _Completionist++_ achievement.
