### Background

_Check out my [blog post](/blog/completionist) for the full story._

I've always loved completionist games - whether it's finding 100% of the gems, dragons, and eggs in Spyro, getting the coveted 112% in Hollow Knight, or completing all of the Skyrim questlines - but Balatro has been the most time-intensive challenge yet.

For anyone that hasn't played Balatro, it's basically poker on steroids. You can upgrade, clone, and remove cards from your deck, there is a shop where you can buy and sell items, and you have a set of _Jokers_ which come with all kinds of abilities - from being able to make flushes/straights with 4 cards, to giving bonuses based on the suits, poker hands, and card values you play, to adding a new random card to your deck every round, and those are the **easy to explain** bonuses. Explaining every aspect of this game would take hours - from decks, enhancements, editions, seals, and tarot/spectral/planet cards to vouchers, tags, antes, blinds and bosses - but it mainly centers around scoring as many points as possible with your deck and this set of jokers.

There are 31 achievements in the game. You will get 20 of them if you just play casually for long enough. 7 of them require you to strategize and structure whole runs around, or otherwise get lucky. And 4 of them are soul-suckingly difficult. This tool is for the final Completionist++ achievement of Balatro.
