_A web app for tracking progress on Balatro's gruelingly difficult achievements_

![Balatro Logo](/images-portfolio/balatro-tracker/Balatro_cover.jpg)

Balatro is a deckbuilding game that takes poker and turns it up to eleven. Engaging and accessible, it also boasts some of **modern gaming's most devlishly challenging achievements**. This simple web app helps players track their progress as they slowly lose their minds on the grueling journey.

For anyone that hasn't played Balatro, it's basically poker on steroids. You can upgrade, clone, and remove cards from your deck, there is a shop where you can buy and sell items, and you have a set of _Jokers_ which come with all kinds of abilities.

There are 31 achievements in the game - 20 of which anyone can get casually, 7 of which require solid strategy and dedication, and the remaining 4 of which are designed to _suck the living soul out of your body_.

I completed the final achievement on August 22nd, 2025 - I used this tool to visualize and track my progress on the final _Completionist++_ achievement.
