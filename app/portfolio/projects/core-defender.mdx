_A subversive mobile game where players solve sensor-based puzzles to rid their device of a malicious entity's infection_

**Play Time:** 20-30 minutes

A subversive mobile puzzle game that presents as a simple tower defense game, but quickly transforms when the player's phone becomes "infected" and they must solve puzzles using mobile device capabilities to clear the infection and restore their phone's functions.

    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">The Deception</h3>
    <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      The game begins innocently enough - players see what looks like a typical
      tower defense interface. But as they progress, strange glitches appear,
      the UI becomes corrupted, and they realize something is wrong with their
      device. The "tower defense" elements are actually a facade, masking the
      real challenge: their phone has been infected, and they need to restore
      its native capabilities through clever puzzle-solving.

      The game transforms your phone into a puzzle-solving device by utilizing:
    </p>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-sm mb-4">
      <li>
        <strong>Accelerometer/Gyroscope</strong>: One puzzle requires players to
        achieve 75+ m/s² acceleration (over 7.5 g-forces) - solved by literally
        throwing your phone into a couch cushion
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Magnetometer (Compass)</strong>: Navigational puzzles using the
        device's magnetic field detection
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Screen Brightness</strong>: Puzzles that require adjusting
        brightness to specific levels
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Location Services</strong>: GPS-based challenges and
        location-aware puzzles
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Microphone</strong>: Audio-based puzzles and voice recognition
        challenges
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Camera</strong>: Visual puzzles requiring photo capture or
        real-world object recognition
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flashlight</strong>: Light-based puzzles and environmental
        interaction

## Live Demo Highlights

The live demonstration included the infamous "phone chucking" puzzle, where I achieved 103 m/s² (over 10 g-forces) by throwing my phone into a couch cushion - successfully solving the accelerometer puzzle and proving the game's innovative approach to mobile interaction.

## Technical Implementation

- **App Framework**: React Native with Expo Go for cross-platform compatibility
- **AI Integration**: Sora AI for generating the creepy demon character and narrative elements
- **Video Production**: Final Cut Pro for editing transitions and creating the deceptive presentation
- **Sensor Integration**: Comprehensive use of device APIs for authentic puzzle mechanics

## Inspirations

- **There Is No Game**: Subversion of gaming expectations
- **Blackbox**: Clever use of device capabilities
- **Pony Island**: Meta-narrative and deception
- **Her Story**: Unconventional storytelling through interaction
- **Thronglets**: New Black Mirror game

## The Experience

Core Defender explores how we interact with our devices and what happens when those familiar interfaces become corrupted. It challenges players to think outside the box, using their phone in unexpected ways - from throwing it across the room to shining its flashlight in specific patterns.

The game makes players question their assumptions about mobile gaming while showcasing the potential of modern smartphone capabilities when used creatively.
