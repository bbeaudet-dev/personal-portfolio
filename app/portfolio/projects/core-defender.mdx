A subversive puzzle game that tricks players into thinking it's a tower defense game, when in reality their phone has become "infected" and they must solve puzzles using the device's native capabilities to restore functionality.

## Overview

The original idea relied on deception and exploration of mobile devices' native features. What appears to be a straightforward tower defense game is actually a puzzle experience that uses every sensor and capability of modern smartphones. Players discover that their device has been compromised by a mysterious entity, and they must solve puzzles that require them to interact with their phone in unexpected ways.

## The Deception

The game begins innocently enough - players see what looks like a typical tower defense interface. But as they progress, strange glitches appear, the UI becomes corrupted, and they realize something is wrong with their device. The "tower defense" elements are actually a facade, masking the real challenge: their phone has been infected, and they need to restore its native capabilities through clever puzzle-solving.

## Native Capability Puzzles

The game transforms your phone into a puzzle-solving device by utilizing:

- **Accelerometer/Gyroscope**: One puzzle requires players to achieve 75+ m/s² acceleration (over 7.5 g-forces) - solved by literally throwing your phone into a couch cushion
- **Magnetometer (Compass)**: Navigational puzzles using the device's magnetic field detection
- **Screen Brightness**: Puzzles that require adjusting brightness to specific levels
- **Location Services**: GPS-based challenges and location-aware puzzles
- **Microphone**: Audio-based puzzles and voice recognition challenges
- **Camera**: Visual puzzles requiring photo capture or real-world object recognition
- **Flashlight**: Light-based puzzles and environmental interaction

## Live Demo Highlights

The live demonstration included the infamous "phone chucking" puzzle, where I achieved 103 m/s² (over 10 g-forces) by throwing my phone into a couch cushion - successfully solving the accelerometer puzzle and proving the game's innovative approach to mobile interaction.

## Technical Implementation

- **App Framework**: React Native with Expo Go for cross-platform compatibility
- **AI Integration**: Sora AI for generating the creepy demon character and narrative elements
- **Video Production**: Final Cut Pro for editing transitions and creating the deceptive presentation
- **Sensor Integration**: Comprehensive use of device APIs for authentic puzzle mechanics

## Inspirations

- **There Is No Game**: Subversion of gaming expectations
- **Blackbox**: Clever use of device capabilities
- **Pony Island**: Meta-narrative and deception
- **Her Story**: Unconventional storytelling through interaction

## The Experience

Core Defender explores how we interact with our devices and what happens when those familiar interfaces become corrupted. It challenges players to think outside the box, using their phone in unexpected ways - from throwing it across the room to shining its flashlight in specific patterns.

The game makes players question their assumptions about mobile gaming while showcasing the potential of modern smartphone capabilities when used creatively.
