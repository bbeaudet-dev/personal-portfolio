_An AI chatbot that poses lateral-thinking riddles and engages users in puzzle-solving conversations_

## Overview

Riddlemaster is a conversational AI that specializes in riddles and brain teasers. It plays what I have traditionally called the role of "God" - while technically they are limited to only "Yes" and "No" answers, making the riddle-solving experience enjoyable takes much more subtlety and nuance to pull off well. "God" is there not just to answer yes or no questions, but also to sense when the user is getting frustrated, or is headed down the wrong rabbit hole, or when they are moving in the right direction - and to adapt accordingly for the best possible experience. The magic of lateral thinking puzzles truly lies in the element of discovery, of the player arriving at the solution on their own - and "God" is there to cultivate this feeling.
