_Helping stroke patients regain feeling with a rehab therapy device utilizing Bluetooth, touch sensors, haptic feedback, and ergonomic CAD designs_

## Overview

Led a team of 5 engineers in developing an innovative mirror therapy rehabilitation device for stroke patients. Using design-thinking methodology, we created a device that combines Bluetooth connectivity, haptic feedback, and touch sensors to help patients regain feeling and control in affected body parts through mirror therapy techniques.

## Key Contributions

- **Design Thinking Process**: Conducted patient interviews and needs assessment to understand rehabilitation therapy requirements
- **CAD Modeling**: Generated detailed CAD models and 3D-printed prototypes that led to a final product 75% cheaper than market alternatives
- **Hardware Integration**: Implemented touch sensors and haptic feedback systems with Bluetooth communication between device components
- **Software Collaboration**: Worked with software team to design engaging games and activities that increased patient engagement
- **Manufacturing**: Prototyped multiple iterations using local London manufacturing facilities

## Technical Design

The device consists of two ergonomic hand-held components that communicate via Bluetooth:

- **Touch Sensors**: Integrated on one side to detect patient interaction
- **Haptic Feedback**: Implemented on the opposite side to provide sensory stimulation
- **Arched Handle**: Rigid mounting system for Arduino boards and electronics, designed for physical therapist guidance
- **Bluetooth Communication**: Enables real-time coordination between device components

## Design Process

Following the design-thinking methodology, we:

1. **Empathized** with stroke patients and physical therapists to understand rehabilitation needs
2. **Defined** the core problem: lack of affordable, engaging mirror therapy devices
3. **Ideated** multiple design concepts and evaluated feasibility
4. **Prototyped** several iterations using CAD models and 3D printing
5. **Tested** with patients and therapists to refine the design

## Impact

The final device significantly increased therapy effectiveness for stroke patients while being 75% more affordable than existing market alternatives. The integration of gamification elements through software collaboration helped increase patient engagement and adherence to therapy protocols.

## Personal Significance

This project was particularly meaningful as it marked the beginning of my relationship with my future wife, who I met and worked alongside during this London-based project. The experience of applying engineering principles to solve real healthcare challenges while building meaningful relationships demonstrated the human impact that technical work can have.

## Reflection

This project taught me the importance of user-centered design and the value of interdisciplinary collaboration. Working directly with patients and healthcare professionals provided insights that pure technical development would have missed. The experience of creating something that could genuinely improve people's lives through rehabilitation therapy was incredibly rewarding and shaped my approach to engineering projects.
