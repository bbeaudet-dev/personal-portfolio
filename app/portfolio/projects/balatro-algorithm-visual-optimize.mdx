## Background

This project was born from pure over-ambition during our algorithms week at Fractal Tech. Having understood the algorithms lecture super well and pompously holding my math minor in the back of my mind, I decided that the measly sorting algorithms they suggested for us were not enough of a challenge for my superior brains, and that attempting to animate Balatro's scoring algorithm would be more in line with my caliber of computer science expertise. Oh, and I forgot to mention: I was also planning to do this _in addition to_ my [internship with Cerelog](/portfolio/cerelog) workload.

Boy, I don't think I've ever been more wrong in my whole life.

After a Monday struggling to make any meaningful progress, I had basically already given up on the idea and decided to spend the evening seeing how far I could get 100% vibe coding with Replit. I then spent the next few days struggling to animate one of the simplest sorting algorithms out there.

After a few evenings of vibe coding, this app actually didn't turn out half bad! While it's definitely still AI slop, I'd rather show it off as a creative project than have it never see the light of day as a "failed optimization app".
