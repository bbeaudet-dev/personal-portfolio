## Overview

Designed, manufactured, and tested a reciprocating positive displacement cylinder-piston pump to maximize water mass pumped in a five-minute competition. This comprehensive project involved the complete design and manufacturing process for all four critical components: piston, cylinder, connecting rod, and crankshaft.

## Key Contributions

- **Complete System Design**: Designed all four major components (piston, cylinder, connecting rod, crankshaft) as an integrated system
- **Manufacturing Process**: Handled the full manufacturing process from raw materials to finished assembly
- **Quality Control**: Implemented inspection procedures to ensure component quality and fit
- **Performance Testing**: Conducted endurance testing and optimization for maximum efficiency
- **Competition Success**: Achieved first place and set class record in performance competition

## Technical Design

The reciprocating positive displacement pump was designed with the following key features:

- **Piston Design**: Optimized for maximum displacement and minimal friction
- **Cylinder Assembly**: Precision-machined for optimal piston fit and sealing
- **Connecting Rod**: Engineered for strength and efficient power transmission
- **Crankshaft**: Balanced design for smooth operation and maximum power output

## Manufacturing Process

The project involved hands-on manufacturing of all components:

- **Material Selection**: Chose appropriate materials for each component based on performance requirements
- **Precision Machining**: Used various machining techniques to achieve required tolerances
- **Assembly Process**: Carefully assembled components with proper fit and alignment
- **Testing and Optimization**: Iteratively tested and refined the design for maximum performance

## Competition Results

In an endurance competition against three other teams, our pump achieved:

- **First Place Finish**: Outperformed all competing designs
- **Class Record**: Set new benchmark for water mass pumped in five minutes
- **Performance**: Successfully pumped 18 gallons in the five-minute competition period

## Technical Challenges

The project presented several engineering challenges:

- **System Integration**: Ensuring all four components worked together optimally
- **Manufacturing Tolerances**: Achieving precise fits between moving components
- **Performance Optimization**: Balancing power output with reliability and efficiency
- **Competition Constraints**: Working within time and material limitations

## Impact and Learning

This project provided comprehensive experience in:

- **Full Product Lifecycle**: From concept to manufacturing to testing
- **Mechanical Design**: Applying engineering principles to real-world problems
- **Manufacturing Processes**: Understanding the relationship between design and production
- **Performance Optimization**: Iterative testing and refinement for maximum efficiency

## Reflection

This project demonstrated the importance of systems thinking in mechanical design. Creating a successful pump required understanding how each component affected the overall system performance, not just individual component optimization. The hands-on manufacturing experience provided valuable insights into the practical challenges of turning design concepts into working products.

The competition aspect added real-world pressure and constraints that mirrored professional engineering challenges, requiring both technical skill and practical problem-solving under time constraints.
