_Designing and manufacturing a steel piston-cylinder pump that won the "Golden Bolt" for its top-of-the-class performance_

## Overview

Designed, manufactured, and tested a reciprocating positive displacement cylinder-piston pump to maximize water mass pumped in a five-minute class-wide competition. This project involved the complete design and manufacturing process for all four critical components: piston, cylinder, connecting rod, and crankshaft.

## Key Contributions

- **Complete System Design**: Designed all four major components (piston, cylinder, connecting rod, crankshaft) using Autodesk Inventor
- **Manufacturing Process**: Handled the full manufacturing process from raw materials to finished assembly
- **Quality Control**: Implemented inspection procedures to ensure component quality and fit
- **Performance Testing**: Conducted endurance testing and optimization for maximum efficiency
- **Competition Success**: Achieved first place and set class record in performance competition

## Impact and Reflection

This project provided comprehensive experience in:

- **Full Product Lifecycle**: From concept to manufacturing to testing
- **Mechanical Design**: Applying engineering principles to real-world problems
- **Manufacturing Processes**: Understanding the relationship between design and production
- **Performance Optimization**: Iterative testing and refinement for maximum efficiency

This project demonstrated the importance of systems thinking in mechanical design. Creating a successful pump required understanding how each component affected the overall system performance, not just individual component optimization. The hands-on manufacturing experience provided valuable insights into the practical challenges of turning design concepts into working physical products. The competition aspect added real-world pressure and constraints that mirrored professional engineering challenges, requiring both technical skill and practical problem-solving under time constraints.
