_Using MATLAB for mathematical modeling and analysis of airplane wing behavior under nonlinear failure conditions_

## Overview

Conducted a comprehensive case study on nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory in aeroelastic instability (flutter) of aircraft wings, based on Earl Dowell's research. This project involved mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, and visualization of complex aerodynamic phenomena using MATLAB.

## Key Contributions

- **Mathematical Modeling**: Developed four state-space equations from Dowell's airfoil model with pitch and plunge degrees of freedom
- **Numerical Analysis**: Implemented MATLAB's ode23 solver to analyze time-domain responses and phase portraits
- **Bifurcation Analysis**: Produced comprehensive bifurcation diagrams showing Hopf Bifurcation and flutter point prediction
- **Stability Analysis**: Demonstrated static and dynamic instabilities through computational simulation
- **Research Documentation**: Analyzed results consistent with commercial aircraft flying speed recommendations

## Technical Methodology

Using Dowell's airfoil model and governing equations of motion with pitch and plunge DoFs, I produced a 2DoF system of 2nd-order ODEs and solved them with initial conditions using MATLAB's ode23. This allowed for:

- **Time-Domain Analysis**: Simulation of airfoil responses demonstrating various instability modes
- **Phase Portrait Generation**: Visualization of pitch and plunge dynamics showing limit-cycle oscillations (LCOs)
- **Bifurcation Mapping**: Extensive initial condition sets to produce bifurcation diagrams
- **Flutter Point Prediction**: Identification of critical velocity causing simple harmonic motion

## Key Findings

The analysis successfully:

- **Identified Hopf Bifurcation**: Demonstrated the transition from stable to unstable behavior
- **Predicted Flutter Points**: Determined critical velocities for system instability
- **Validated Results**: Confirmed consistency with commercial aircraft operating parameters
- **Revealed LCOs**: Showed evidence of limit-cycle oscillations in phase portraits

## Computational Challenges

The project involved significant computational resources, with individual bifurcation diagrams taking MATLAB 48 hours to generate. This highlighted the computational intensity of nonlinear dynamics analysis and the need for efficient numerical methods.

## Future Work

The research identified several areas for continued investigation:

- **Multiple Time Scales Method**: Potential for more suitable analysis of weak nonlinearities
- **Hopf Bifurcation Theorem**: Further analysis of non-hyperbolicity, transversality, and genericity
- **Stability Charts**: Creation of comprehensive bifurcation sets (requiring ~100+ bifurcation diagrams)
- **Parameter Space Exploration**: Visualization of stable and unstable regions across parameter sets

## Personal Impact

This project was foundational in my development as a computational engineer and had a profound influence on my future career in software engineering. The experience of using MATLAB to apply complex mathematical concepts like nonlinear dynamics, chaos theory, and differential equations to produce meaningful results demonstrated the power of computational tools in engineering analysis.

The project also had a serendipitous personal connection - my MATLAB skills from this research helped me win over my future wife during an 8-hour flight to London, where I would later work on the mirror therapy rehabilitation device project.

## Reflection

This research project taught me the importance of computational thinking and the value of mathematical modeling in engineering analysis. The experience of translating complex physical phenomena into mathematical models and then implementing those models computationally was instrumental in developing my problem-solving approach. The computational challenges and the need for efficient numerical methods also foreshadowed my later interest in software engineering and optimization.
