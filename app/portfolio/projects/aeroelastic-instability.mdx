_Using MATLAB for mathematical modeling and analysis of aircraft wing behavior under nonlinear failure conditions_

## Overview

Conducted a comprehensive case study on nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory in aeroelastic instability (flutter) of aircraft wings, based on Earl Dowell's previous research. This project involved mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, and visualization of complex aerodynamic phenomena using MATLAB.

- **Mathematical Modeling**: Developed four state-space equations from Dowell's airfoil model with pitch and plunge degrees of freedom
- **Numerical Analysis**: Implemented MATLAB's ode23 solver to analyze time-domain responses and phase portraits
- **Bifurcation Analysis**: Produced comprehensive bifurcation diagrams showing Hopf Bifurcation and flutter point prediction
- **Stability Analysis**: Demonstrated static and dynamic instabilities through computational simulation
- **Analysis Results**: Analyzed results consistent with commercial aircraft flying speed recommendations

## Technical Methodology

Using Dowell's airfoil model and governing equations of motion with pitch and plunge DoFs, I produced a 2DoF system of 2nd-order ODEs and solved them with initial conditions using MATLAB's ode23. This allowed for:

- **Time-Domain Analysis**: Simulation of airfoil responses demonstrating various instability modes
- **Phase Portrait Generation**: Visualization of pitch and plunge dynamics showing limit-cycle oscillations (LCOs)
- **Bifurcation Mapping**: Extensive initial condition sets to produce bifurcation diagrams
- **Flutter Point Prediction**: Identification of critical velocity causing simple harmonic motion

## Key Findings

The analysis successfully:

- **Identified Hopf Bifurcation**: Demonstrated the transition from stable to unstable behavior
- **Predicted Flutter Points**: Determined critical velocities for system instability
- **Validated Results**: Confirmed consistency with commercial aircraft operating parameters
- **Revealed LCOs**: Showed evidence of limit-cycle oscillations in phase portraits

## Future Work

The research identified several areas for continued investigation:

- **Multiple Time Scales Method**: Potential for more suitable analysis of weak nonlinearities
- **Hopf Bifurcation Theorem**: Further analysis of non-hyperbolicity, transversality, and genericity
- **Stability Charts**: Creation of comprehensive bifurcation sets (requiring ~100+ bifurcation diagrams)
- **Parameter Space Exploration**: Visualization of stable and unstable regions across parameter sets

## Personal Impact

This project was foundational in my development as an engineer and had a profound influence on my future career in software engineering. The experience of using MATLAB to apply complex mathematical concepts like nonlinear dynamics, chaos theory, and differential equations to produce meaningful results demonstrated the power of computational tools in engineering analysis.

The project involved significant computational challenges, with individual bifurcation diagrams taking MATLAB 48 hours to generate, as well as the difficulty of producing and making sense of complicated diagrams and graphs. However, working through these difficulties for 5 months and coming out with beautiful diagrams and a succinct, validated result was an experience I will never forget.
