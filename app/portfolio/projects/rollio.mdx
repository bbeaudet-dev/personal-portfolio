A modular, full-featured spin of the classic Farkle dice game, supporting multiple interfaces including CLI, Web, and a React App. The project is designed for extensibility and code reuse, with a clear separation between game logic and user interface.

## Overview

Rollio Dice Game brings the classic dice game to modern platforms, allowing users to play via command line, web browser, or a React-based UI. The core logic is shared across all interfaces, ensuring consistent gameplay and easy maintenance.

## Features

- Playable via CLI, Web, and React App
- Modular architecture with shared game logic
- Full ruleset and scoring (ones, fives, straights, triplets, etc.)
- Multiple player support
- State management and game persistence
- Custom terminal-inspired UI theme (for web/React)
- Extensible for new features and variants

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript (core logic and all interfaces)
- React (web app UI)
- Node.js & Express (API/server)
- Vite (frontend tooling)
- Tailwind CSS (custom terminal theme)

My goal was to create a dice-rolling game that is delightful and can be run purely from the command line. This inspiration came from many tough lessons learned by poor separation of concerns, i.e. mixing the game engine between frontend and backend, and from getting too far into making something look pretty before it's fun.
