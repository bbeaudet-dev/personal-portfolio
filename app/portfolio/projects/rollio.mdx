My goal with Rollio was to create a dice-rolling game that is delightful and can be run purely from the command line. This inspiration came from many tough lessons learned by poor separation of concerns, i.e. mixing the game engine between frontend and backend, and from getting too far into making something look pretty before it's fun.
