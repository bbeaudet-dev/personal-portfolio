**Play Time:** 10-30 minutes

A real-time multiplayer dice game that blends risk-it-all dice-rolling with roguelike progression elements. Players compete in live sessions with WebSocket-powered real-time updates, featuring a full-stack architecture deployed across multiple platforms.

Rollio represents my journey from CLI-first development to a complete full-stack multiplayer experience. Starting as a command-line game to focus on core mechanics and making a simple, _delightful_ game, it eventually scaled into a full-stack application.

## Features

- Real-time multiplayer gameplay with live WebSocket connections
- Farkle-inspired dice mechanics with strategic decision-making
- Roguelike progression system with persistent player stats
- Cross-platform deployment (Vercel frontend, Render backend)
- Live game state synchronization across all connected players
- Session management with unique game rooms

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript (core logic and type safety across frontend/backend)
- React (modern frontend with real-time state management)
- Node.js & Express (RESTful API and WebSocket server)
- Socket.io (real-time bidirectional communication)
- Vercel (frontend deployment with automatic scaling)
- Render (backend deployment with persistent WebSocket connections)
