          My relationship with games has evolved significantly over the years. Some of my earliest memories are of playing <strong>Pokemon</strong> on long car rides, simply something to do to fill the in-between time.

              As I grew older, games like <strong>Minecraft</strong> became an escape from difficult emotions and responsibilities.

              Out of college, I discovered transformative story-driven games that changed me as a person - starting with <strong>Horizon Zero Dawn</strong> and <strong>Subnautica</strong>, and then, once I met my good friend Parth, games like <strong>Undertale</strong>, <strong>Firewatch</strong>, <strong>Hollow Knight</strong>, <strong>Celeste</strong>, and <strong>Outer Wilds</strong> became foundational.

            <p className="text-sm text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-400 mb-6">
              A few years later, having seemingly exhausted all of the "Undertale-like" games, I discovered the world of Sudoku variants - clever rulesets and endless variations that activated the logical, analytical, and creative parts of my brain - eventually leading me to pursue mechanical engineering and technical design work.

            <p className="text-sm text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-400 mb-6">
              As I explored coding and automation in my technical role, I gravitated toward games about building and designing systems - games like <strong>Faster Than Light</strong>, <strong>Plate Up</strong>, <strong>Factorio</strong>, <strong>Opus Magnum</strong>, and <strong>Balatro</strong> that give me the same rush as coding.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-sm text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-400">
              While designing and building games for real money would be a dream come true, I still wrestle with the feeling that they're "just games" and that my intelligence might be better used elsewhere. Nevertheless, I can now celebrate and appreciate my relationship with games and how they have shaped me as a human.
