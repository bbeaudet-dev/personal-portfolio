# The Art of Show-Maxxing

We call it **show-maxxing**—the ultimate Broadway binge. It's not just seeing shows; it's an art form, a lifestyle, a carefully orchestrated dance between TKTS booths, matinees, and red-eye flights.

## What is Show-Maxxing?

**Show-Maxxing** (verb): The art of cramming as many Broadway shows as humanly possible into a single NYC weekend. Typically involves meticulous planning, multiple trips to TKTS, strategic meals, and an aggressive schedule of Friday night through Sunday matinee performances—followed by a red-eye home and zero regrets.

_Example: "We're show-maxxing this weekend: five shows in 48 hours."_

## The Perfect Show-Maxxing Weekend

### Friday: The Arrival

- ✈ **Fly in early** (take Friday off work)
- 🏨 **Uber to hotel**, drop bags in storage
- 🎟 **Get to TKTS by 2:30 PM** (opens at 3 PM), buy Friday night & Saturday matinee tickets
- 🛍 **Back to hotel**, retrieve bags, check in, unpack, shower, and get dressed
- 🍽 **Quick dinner**
- 🎭 **Friday Evening Show**
- 😴 **Sleep**

### Saturday: The Marathon

- ☀ **Wake up**, hotel breakfast
- 🎟 **Back to TKTS** (11 AM opening) for Saturday evening tickets (and any missed matinee)
- 🍽 **Grab lunch**
- 🎭 **Saturday Matinee**
- 🎟 **Return to TKTS** for Sunday matinee tickets
- 🏨 **Hotel pit stop** (freshen up, outfit change)
- 🍽 **Dinner**
- 🎭 **Saturday Evening Show**
- 😴 **Sleep**

### Sunday: The Grand Finale

- ☀ **Wake up**, hotel breakfast
- 🎟 **(if needed) back to TKTS** for last-minute Sunday matinee
- 🎭 **Sunday Matinee**
- 🧳 **Back to hotel**, grab bags
- ✈ **Head to airport**
- 🍽 **Dinner at the terminal**
- 🛬 **Fly home**

### Monday: The Recovery

- ☕ **Straight back to work** (running on Broadway magic and caffeine)

## The Show-Maxxing Philosophy

Some people go to NYC for the sights. We go for the TKTS line at 11 AM.

Show-maxxing isn't about relaxation—it's about **maximization**. Every minute counts. You're not there to see the Statue of Liberty or Times Square; you're there to see as much live theatre as humanly possible in 48 hours.

## Why We Do It

My first trip to New York City (in 2022) was with my then-fiancee Sophia and her friend Rose. Despite living in the city with the second-largest theatre district (Cleveland's Playhouse Square), it was this trip that truly unlocked the magic of theatre for me.

I didn't even _anticipate_ liking Broadway shows very much - in fact, I primarily was in town to play in a squash tournament and watch the Tournament of Champions at Grand Central Terminal. So while the two of them went "show-maxxing" (a term we maybe invented?) I spent most of the weekend doing squash. Eventually I went with them to see **POTUS** and I was hooked from there. I have Rose to thank for the initial introduction.

## The Logistics

### TKTS Strategy

- **Friday**: Arrive by 2:30 PM for 3 PM opening
- **Saturday**: Back at 11 AM sharp
- **Sunday**: One more trip if needed
- **Pro tip**: Have backup shows in mind for each time slot

### Hotel Location

Stay within walking distance of Times Square. You'll be making multiple trips back to your room for outfit changes and freshening up.

### Meal Planning

- Quick breakfast at the hotel
- Grab-and-go lunches
- Dinner reservations near the theatre district
- Snacks for between shows

## The Aftermath

You'll be exhausted. You'll be exhilarated. You'll have seen more theatre in one weekend than most people see in a year. And you'll be planning your next show-maxxing trip before you even land back home.

That's show-maxxing—no time wasted, just back-to-back Broadway bliss.
