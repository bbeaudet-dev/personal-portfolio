I want to add a couple of sentences maximum to the top of my broadway review list, just to say what I love about it, how I came across it, and what I hope the reader gains.  My first trip to New York City was with my then-fiancee and her friend in April 2022. Since I was playing in a squash tournament and planned on watching the Tournament of Champions at Grand Central Terminal, it worked out well that Sophia's friend Rose came along with us. They went "show-maxxing" a term we maybe invented(?) while I spent most of the weekend doing squash. Eventually I went with them to see POTUS and I was hooked from there. 

I have Rose to thank for the initial introduction

What is it that I love?
Ranking is fun
Allegory, emotional depth, resonance
Live performance
Live orchestra
