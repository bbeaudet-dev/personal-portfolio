Waiting for R, saw N, got on Q oops, door close, door open, dash out, R is there, get on R, couple stops, think I’m gonna make it, uh oh R is held at the station, just catch “N will be leaving before us”, dash out, N is there, get on N, take it to 49th, car is right at the 47th st station, I.e. right next to TKTS.  QRN. Left work at 6:55, figured I just needed to get to the show with 15 mins and 15 minute walk, ETA 8:06 on the L. “We’re gonna get you better seats”. More of a movie theater, but cool symbols. He seems legit even if the presentation is a little cheesy.

Stage 42 is not your typical theatre, it’s more of a movie theater. No mexzanine, everything is “orchestra”. But still, why not want to be as close as possible to the spectacle? When it comes to broadway, every seat closer is gold. So moving from N101 to G1 is huge! That’s a $50+ ticket price, usually! Anyways, the “value” isn’t important, but what was important was that I had a WAY better view, it was like looking at the hotel pool from your room vs having your toes dipped in. I felt amongst the rest of the people, not above.

Quite the ego for lord of nothing. Tada! After every trick. Felt a bit pick me, I expected a lot more idk zen and signs of actual skill that he gained over all those years of training? Maybe I’m just a Broadway fan, but I was more impressed with the dancers and main woman. Gluttony looked hard, envy was kinda cool crossbow, greed was cool but maybe a setup? Lust was great, but the actual challenge was kinda just a gotcha, pride was decent, wrath could’ve been cool I feel like but I could never tell how difficult these things were, like it often looked like he was “trying to struggle”, and fine he’s an actor I guess but idk it was weird. Obviously he does the show everyday and he’s trying to give the audience the appearance that he’s in a new environment, but I guess I saw through it. Speaking of seeing through it, sloth was cool, I At least like the vibe and story, I feel like the maze could’ve been more intense. Overall I wish there was more explanation and like what’s going on, but obviously a magician never reveals his tricks, but then again it wasn’t really magic. A lot more dancing and theatre than I expected. Guitar guy was a joke, sorry. Even if he was playing, there were many times when the guitar is NOT him and it kinda just delegitimizes him.
