The first time I tried to get tickets, Jak Malone was out and I said NO THANKS. I knew very little about the show except that I was going to like "Dear Bill" and that Jak Malone was the Tony/Olivier Award Winner.

The next time I tried, I ended up in the balcony and sat next to the loudest person I have ever witnessed. It was like they were ticklish, or allergic, to theatre, like she couldn't help but laugh at every single semblance of ANYTHING funny, or even POSSIBLY funny. And her laugh was LOUD, loud enough that I brought out earplugs for the first ever time during a show. And I couldn't really hear a damn thing the whole show, but my friend and I at least had a laugh about it. I liked it well enough, and thankfully the ONLY song she didn't laugh during was "Dear Bill", which just crushed me. Being away for the whole summer for Fractal's bootcamp, it did feel very akin to being "off at war", like this was our story. Instead of roses, Sophia was at home taking care of my Tesla, whose battery died while I was away :D

When I found cheap orchestra tickets with another friend, I didn't hesitate. The show was infinitely better than I remembered - and I had it in the top 10 before! After seeing it a second time (and being able to hear it), it now sits at spot #6.

Obviously orchestra is usually preferable to balcony, and the prices reflect it, but I would recommend trying to get orchestra, even if it's the very last row like ours were, as I enjoyed the view a lot better. "Dear Bill" crushed me even more the second time around and I would pretty much recommend going to see the show for that one song alone. The rest of the show isn't for everyone, admittedly, but I enjoy British humor, and I think it's quite well done and unique. This is a show that I really didn't think I would end up liking much at all, but was very pleasantly surprised by - and planning to see for a third time with my wife!
